# ADS-B/FLARM Receivers

PX4 supports simple air traffic avoidance in [missions](../flight_modes/mission.md) using [ADS-B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_dependent_surveillance_%E2%80%93_broadcast) or [FLARM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLARM) transponders that have a MAVLink interface (that emits the [ADSB_VEHICLE](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#ADSB_VEHICLE) message)).

For more information on supported peripherals see [Air Traffic Avoidance: ADSB/FLARM](../advanced_features/traffic_avoidance_adsb.md#supported_hardware).
