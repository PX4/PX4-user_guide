## dshot
Source: [drivers/dshot](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/tree/master/src/drivers/dshot)


### Description
This is the DShot output driver. It is similar to the fmu driver, and can be used as drop-in replacement
to use DShot as ESC communication protocol instead of PWM.

It supports:
- DShot150, DShot300, DShot600, DShot1200
- telemetry via separate UART and publishing as esc_status message
- sending DShot commands via CLI

### Examples
Permanently reverse motor 1:
```
dshot reverse -m 1
dshot save -m 1
```
After saving, the reversed direction will be regarded as the normal one. So to reverse again repeat the same commands.

## gps
Source: [drivers/gps](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/tree/master/src/drivers/gps)


### Description
GPS driver module that handles the communication with the device and publishes the position via uORB.
It supports multiple protocols (device vendors) and by default automatically selects the correct one.

The module supports a secondary GPS device, specified via `-e` parameter. The position will be published
on the second uORB topic instance, but it's currently not used by the rest of the system (however the
data will be logged, so that it can be used for comparisons).

### Implementation
There is a thread for each device polling for data. The GPS protocol classes are implemented with callbacks
so that they can be used in other projects as well (eg. QGroundControl uses them too).

### Examples
For testing it can be useful to fake a GPS signal (it will signal the system that it has a valid position):
```
gps stop
gps start -f
```

Starting 2 GPS devices (the main GPS on /dev/ttyS3 and the secondary on /dev/ttyS4):
```
gps start -d /dev/ttyS3 -e /dev/ttyS4
```

Initiate warm restart of GPS device
```
gps reset warm
```

## ina226
Source: [drivers/power_monitor/ina226](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/tree/master/src/drivers/power_monitor/ina226)


### Description
Driver for the INA226 power monitor.

Multiple instances of this driver can run simultaneously, if each instance has a separate bus OR I2C address.

For example, one instance can run on Bus 2, address 0x41, and one can run on Bus 2, address 0x43.

If the INA226 module is not powered, then by default, initialization of the driver will fail. To change this, use
the -f flag. If this flag is set, then if initialization fails, the driver will keep trying to initialize again
every 0.5 seconds. With this flag set, you can plug in a battery after the driver starts, and it will work. Without
this flag set, the battery must be plugged in before starting the driver.

## pwm_out
Source: [drivers/pwm_out](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/tree/master/src/drivers/pwm_out)


### Description
This module is responsible for driving the output and reading the input pins. For boards without a separate IO chip
(eg. Pixracer), it uses the main channels. On boards with an IO chip (eg. Pixhawk), it uses the AUX channels, and the
px4io driver is used for main ones.

It listens on the actuator_controls topics, does the mixing and writes the PWM outputs.

The module is configured via mode_* commands. This defines which of the first N pins the driver should occupy.
By using mode_pwm4 for example, pins 5 and 6 can be used by the camera trigger driver or by a PWM rangefinder
driver. Alternatively, pwm_out can be started in one of the capture modes, and then drivers can register a capture
callback with ioctl calls.

### Implementation
By default the module runs on a work queue with a callback on the uORB actuator_controls topic.

### Examples
It is typically started with:
```
pwm_out mode_pwm
```
To drive all available pins.

Capture input (rising and falling edges) and print on the console: start pwm_out in one of the capture modes:
```
pwm_out mode_pwm3cap1
```
This will enable capturing on the 4th pin. Then do:
```
pwm_out test
```

Use the `pwm` command for further configurations (PWM rate, levels, ...), and the `mixer` command to load
mixer files.

### Usage

 Commands:

## roboclaw
Source: [drivers/roboclaw](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/tree/master/src/drivers/roboclaw)


### Description

This driver communicates over UART with the [Roboclaw motor driver](http://downloads.basicmicro.com/docs/roboclaw_user_manual.pdf).
It performs two tasks:

 - Control the motors based on the `actuator_controls_0` UOrb topic.
 - Read the wheel encoders and publish the raw data in the `wheel_encoders` UOrb topic

In order to use this driver, the Roboclaw should be put into Packet Serial mode (see the linked documentation), and
your flight controller's UART port should be connected to the Roboclaw as shown in the documentation. For Pixhawk 4,
use the `UART & I2C B` port, which corresponds to `/dev/ttyS3`.

### Implementation

The main loop of this module (Located in `RoboClaw.cpp::task_main()`) performs 2 tasks:

 1. Write `actuator_controls_0` messages to the Roboclaw as they become available
 2. Read encoder data from the Roboclaw at a constant, fixed rate.

Because of the latency of UART, this driver does not write every single `actuator_controls_0` message to the Roboclaw
immediately. Instead, it is rate limited based on the parameter `RBCLW_WRITE_PER`.

On startup, this driver will attempt to read the status of the Roboclaw to verify that it is connected. If this fails,
the driver terminates immediately.

### Examples

The command to start this driver is:

 $ roboclaw start <device> <baud>

`<device>` is the name of the UART port. On the Pixhawk 4, this is `/dev/ttyS3`.
`<baud>` is te baud rate.

All available commands are:

 - `$ roboclaw start <device> <baud>`
 - `$ roboclaw status`
 - `$ roboclaw stop`

### Description
This module is responsible for the safety button.
Pressing the safety button 3 times quickly will trigger a GCS pairing request.

### Usage
```
safety_button <command> [arguments...]

## tap_esc
Source: [drivers/tap_esc](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/tree/master/src/drivers/tap_esc)


### Description
This module controls the TAP_ESC hardware via UART. It listens on the
actuator_controls topics, does the mixing and writes the PWM outputs.

### Implementation
Currently the module is implementd as a threaded version only, meaning that it
runs in its own thread instead of on the work queue.

### Example
The module is typically started with:
tap_esc start -d /dev/ttyS2 -n <1-8>


<a id="tap_esc_usage"></a>
### Usage
```
tap_esc <command> [arguments...]
 Commands:
   start         Start the task
     [-d <val>]  Device used to talk to ESCs
                 values: <device>
     [-n <val>]  Number of ESCs
                 default: 4
```

## vmount
Source: [modules/vmount](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/tree/master/src/modules/vmount)


### Description
Mount (Gimbal) control driver. It maps several different input methods (eg. RC or MAVLink) to a configured
output (eg. AUX channels or MAVLink).

Documentation how to use it is on the [gimbal_control](https://dev.px4.io/master/en/advanced/gimbal_control.html) page.

### Implementation
Each method is implemented in its own class, and there is a common base class for inputs and outputs.
They are connected via an API, defined by the `ControlData` data structure. This makes sure that each input method
can be used with each output method and new inputs/outputs can be added with minimal effort.

### Examples
Test the output by setting a fixed yaw angle (and the other axes to 0):
```
vmount stop
vmount test yaw 30
```

<a id="vmount_usage"></a>
### Usage
```
vmount <command> [arguments...]
 Commands:
   start

   test          Test the output: set a fixed angle for one axis (vmount must
                 not be running)
     roll|pitch|yaw <angle> Specify an axis and an angle in degrees

   stop

   status        print status info
