# Computer Vision (Optical Flow, MoCap, VIO, Avoidance)

[Computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision) techniques enable computers to use visual data to make sense of their environment.

PX4 uses computer vision systems (primarily running on [Companion Computers](../companion_computer/README.md)) in order to support the following features:

- [Optical Flow](#optical-flow) provides 2D velocity estimation (using a downward facing camera and a downward facing distance sensor).
- [Motion Capture](#motion-capture) provides 3D pose estimation using a vision system that is _external_ to the vehicle. It is primarily used for indoor navigation.
- [Visual Inertial Odometry](#visual-inertial-odometry-vio) provides 3D pose and velocity estimation using an onboard vision system and IMU. It is used for navigation when global position information is absent or unreliable.
- [Obstacle Avoidance](../computer_vision/obstacle_avoidance.md) provides full navigation around obstacles when flying a planned path (currently missions are supported). This uses [PX4/PX4-Avoidance](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Avoidance) running on a companion computer.
- [Collision Prevention](../computer_vision/collision_prevention.md) is used to stop vehicles before they can crash into an obstacle (primarily when flying in manual modes).

:::tip
The [PX4 Vision Autonomy Development Kit](../complete_vehicles/px4_vision_kit.md) (Holybro) is a robust and inexpensive kit for developers working with computer vision on PX4. It comes with no pre-installed software, but does include an example implementation of obstacle avoidance to demonstrate the capabilities of the platform.

## Motion Capture

Motion Capture (MoCap) is a technique for estimating the 3D _pose_ (position and orientation) of a vehicle using a positioning mechanism that is _external_ to the vehicle. MoCap systems most commonly detect motion using infrared cameras, but other types of cameras, Lidar, or Ultra Wideband (UWB) may also be used.

:::note
MoCap is commonly used to navigate a vehicle in situations where GPS is absent (e.g. indoors), and provides position relative to a _local_ coordinate system.

For information about MoCap see:

- [External Position Estimation](../ros/external_position_estimation.md)
- [Flying with Motion Capture (VICON, Optitrack)](../tutorials/motion-capture.md)
- [EKF > External Vision System](../advanced_config/tuning_the_ecl_ekf.md#external-vision-system)

## Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO)

Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) is used for estimating the 3D _pose_ (position and orientation) and _velocity_ of a moving vehicle relative to a _local_ starting position. It is commonly used to navigate a vehicle in situations where GPS is absent (e.g. indoors) or unreliable (e.g. when flying under a bridge).

VIO uses [Visual Odometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_odometry) to estimate vehicle _pose_ from visual information, combined with inertial measurements from an IMU (to correct for errors associated with rapid vehicle movement resulting in poor image capture).

:::note
One difference between VIO and [MoCap](#motion-capture) is that VIO cameras/IMU are vehicle-based, and additionally provide velocity information.

- [T265 Setup guide](../peripherals/camera_t265_vio.md)

## Optical Flow

[Optical Flow](../sensor/optical_flow.md) provides 2D velocity estimation (using a downward facing camera and a downward facing distance sensor).

For information about optical flow see:
