# Mounting a GPS/Compass

GPS/Compasses should be mounted on the frame as far away from other electronics as possible, with the direction marker pointing towards the front of the vehicle. You should also configure PX4 to [set the position](#position) of the receiver relative to the centre-of-gravity (CoG).

The diagram below shows the heading marker on the Pixhawk 4 and compass.

## Compass Orientation

The compass can be mounted in any of the standard MAVLink orientations defined in [MAV_SENSOR_ORIENTATION](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#MAV_SENSOR_ORIENTATION). The orientation follows the same frame convention as when [orienting the flight controller](../config/flight_controller_orientation.md#calculating-orientation).

If you're using the normal [Compass Calibration](../config/compass.md) process (with parameter [SENS_MAG_AUTOROT](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#SENS_MAG_AUTOROT) enabled), the orientation should be detected automatically. Otherwise you can directly select the appropriate value in [CAL_MAGn_ROT](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#CAL_MAG1_ROT) for up to three compasses.

:::warning
You must mount the compass in a supported orientation!

If you mount the compass at an orientation that isn't supported, for example `Yaw 30`, PX4 will detect the closest supported value. This will result in errors/warnings, even if the calibration appeared to succeed.

## Position

In order to compensate for the relative motion between the receiver and the CoG, you should [configure](../advanced_config/parameters.md) the following parameters to set the offsets: [EKF2_GPS_POS_X](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_GPS_POS_X), [EKF2_GPS_POS_Y](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_GPS_POS_Y) and [EKF2_GPS_POS_Z](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_GPS_POS_Z).

This is important because the body frame estimated by the EKF will converge on the location of the GNSS module and assume it to be at the CoG. If the GNSS module is significantly offset from the CoG, then rotation around the COG will be interpreted as an altitude change, which in some flight modes (such as position mode) will result in unnecessary corrections.

It is particularly important if using [RTK GNSS](../advanced/rtk_gps.md) which has centimeter-level accuracy, because if the offsets are not set then GNSS measurements will often be rejected as inconsistent with the current EFK estimate.

::: details
Explanation For example, if the GNSS module is 10cm above the CoG, and the IMU is located at the GoG, a pitch motion of 1 rad/s will create a GNSS velocity measurement of 10cm/s _even though the CoG isn't moving_. If the speed accuracy of the GNSS receiver is 1cm/s, the EKF might stop trusting the measurements because they appear inconsistent (wrong by 10x the accuracy). If the offsets are defined, the EKF will correct the measurements using the gyro data.
