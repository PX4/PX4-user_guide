# Drotek XL RTK GPS

The [Drotek XL RTK GPS receiver](https://store-drotek.com/881-DP0503.html) is a competitively priced [RTK GPS module](../gps_compass/rtk_gps.md) that can be configured as either base or rover. Using RTK, PX4 can get its position with centimetre-level accuracy, which is much more accurate than can be provided by a normal GPS.
