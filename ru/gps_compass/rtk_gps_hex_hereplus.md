# HEX/ProfiCNC Here+ RTK GPS

The [Here+ RTK GPS receiver](http://www.proficnc.com/content/12-here) is a small, light and energy efficient [RTK GPS module](../gps_compass/rtk_gps.md), based on the u-blox M8P. Using RTK, PX4 can get its position with centimetre-level accuracy, which is much more accurate than can be provided by a normal GPS.

## Configuration

RTK setup and use on PX4 via *QGroundControl* is largely plug and play (see [RTK GPS](../advanced_features/rtk-gps.md) for more information).

## Pinout

The Here+ GPS comes with an 8 pin connector with the following pinout

| Pin        | Here+ GPS     |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| 1 (purple) | VCC_5V        |
| 2 (blue)   | GPS_RX        |
| 3 (green)  | GPS_TX        |
| 4 (yellow) | I2C SCL       |
| 5 (orange) | I2C SDA       |
| 6 (red)    | SAFETY BUTTON |
| 7 (brown)  | BUTTON_LED    |
| 8 (black)  | GND           |

## Wiring and Connections

Connection examples are shown below for a number of boards (these can be used to modify the cable as needed for other boards).

### Hex Cube

The supplied cable can be inserted directly into the [Hex Cube (Pixhawk 2)](../flight_controller/pixhawk-2.md) GPS UART port.

#### Pixhawk 3 Pro

The [Pixhawk 3 Pro](../flight_controller/pixhawk3_pro.md) and [Pixracer](../flight_controller/pixracer.md) have a 6 pin GPS port connector. For these controllers you can modify the GPS cable (as shown below) to remove pin 6 and 7.

Pin 6 and 7 are for the safety button - these can be attached as well if needed.

| 8   | GND        | 6   | GND               |

#### Pixhawk 4

The Here+ to [Pixhawk 4](../flight_controller/pixhawk4.md) GPS port pin mapping is 1:1 for pins 1-7 and then connect GND (Here+ pin 8 / Pixhawk pin 10). Pixhawk 4 GPS port pins 8 and 9 can be left disconnected.

> **Note** The Pixhawk 4 GPS port has pin 1 on the left hand side.
