Execute the script below to install GCC 7-2017-q4:

```sh
pushd .
cd ~
wget https://armkeil.blob.core.windows.net/developer/Files/downloads/gnu-rm/7-2017q4/gcc-arm-none-eabi-7-2017-q4-major-linux.tar.bz2
tar -jxf gcc-arm-none-eabi-7-2017-q4-major-linux.tar.bz2
exportline="export PATH=$HOME/gcc-arm-none-eabi-7-2017-q4-major/bin:\$PATH"
if grep -Fxq "$exportline" ~/.profile; then echo nothing to do ; else echo $exportline >> ~/.profile; fi
popd
```

Now restart your machine.


**Troubleshooting**

Check the version by entering the following command:

```sh
arm-none-eabi-gcc --version
```

The output should be something similar to:

```sh
arm-none-eabi-gcc (GNU Tools for Arm Embedded Processors 7-2017-q4-major) 7.2.1 20170904 (release) [ARM/embedded-7-branch revision 255204]
