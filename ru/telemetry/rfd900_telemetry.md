# RFD900 Long-Range Telemetry

[jDrones](http://store.jDrones.com) and [RFDesign](http://rfdesign.com.au/) offer *long-range* [SiK](../telemetry/sik_radio.md)-compatible telemetry radios. The radios provide reliable connectivity at greater than 5km ranges with normal antennas (and have been reported to achieve much greater ranges).

> **Tip** *jDrones* have productized *RFDesign* modems (added a casing with power management, filtering and other electronics inside, along with cables to connect to popular flight controllers, and individually validated antennas). The first such modem was the *RFD900*, but both *RFDesign* and *jDrones* have since iterated to new versions.

The *jDrones* radios have a JST-GH connector, and come with cables for: *JST-GH to JST-GH* and *JST-GH to DF-13*. They can therefore be used in a "plug-n-play" way with most [Pixhawk Series](../flight_controller/pixhawk_series.md) controllers (you might have to change/use an appropriate connector for some "non-standard" boards).
