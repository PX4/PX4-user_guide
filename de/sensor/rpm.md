# ThunderFly TFRPM01 tachometer sensor

The [TFRPM01](https://github.com/ThunderFly-aerospace/TFRPM01) is a small, and low system demanding revolution-counter. It must be connected to a IÂ²C bus.

## Hardware Setup

TFRPM01 needs to be connected to any I2C port. The sensor hardware needs an pulse signal. The pulses could be generated by several ways. The usually used principles follows. The TFRPM01 sensor has 3pin pin-header connector with pull-up equipped input where multiple probe types could be connected.

### Hall effect sensor probe

The magnetically operated hall effect sensors are ideal for harsh environment, where dirt, dust and water can contact the sensed rotor. A huge range of hall effect sensor types could be used.  For example a 5100 Miniature Flange Mounting Proximity Sensor is good choice.


### Optical sensor probe

In some cases the optical sensor should better fits the measurement requirements. Both transmissive and reflective sensor types could be used for pulse generation.

## Parameter Setup

There are multiple configurable parameters, although usually nothing need to be changed to get sensor working.

   * [PCF8583_POOL](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#PCF8583_POOL) - pooling interval between readout the counted number
   * [PCF8583_ADDR](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#PCF8583_ADDR) - I2C sensor address
   * [PCF8583_RESET](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#PCF8583_RESET) - Counter value where the counted number should be reset to zero.
   * [PCF8583_MAGNET](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#PCF8583_MAGNET) - Number of pulses per revolution e.g. number of magnets at a rotor disc.
