# RTK GPS

[Real Time Kinematic (RTK)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_Kinematic) GNSS/GPS systems provide centimeter-level accuracy, allowing PX4 to be used in applications like precision surveying (where pinpoint accuracy is essential). This feature requires *QGroundControl* running on a laptop/PC and a vehicle with a WiFi or Telemetry radio link to the ground station laptop.

In addition, [some RTK setups](../gps_compass/u-blox_f9p_heading.md) can provide heading from GPS, which can be used as an alternative to the compass.

Information about supported devices and setup can be found in the section: [Peripheral Hardware > RTK GPS](../gps_compass/rtk_gps.md).
