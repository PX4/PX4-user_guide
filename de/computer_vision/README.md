# Computer Vision (Optical Flow, MoCap, VIO, Avoidance)

[Computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision) techniques enable computers to use visual data to make sense of their environment.

PX4 uses computer vision systems (primarily running on [Companion Computers](../companion_computer/pixhawk_companion.md)) in order to support the following features:
- Pose/Velocity Estimation:
  - [Optical Flow](../sensor/optical_flow.md) provides 2D velocity estimation (using a downward facing camera and a downward facing distance sensor).
  - [Motion Capture](../computer_vision/motion_capture.md) provides 3D pose estimation using a vision system that is *external* to the vehicle. It is primarily used for indoor navigation.
  - [Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO)](../computer_vision/visual_inertial_odometry.md) provides 3D pose and velocity estimation using an onboard vision system and IMU. It is used for navigation when global position information is absent or unreliable.
- Avoidance/Path Planning:
  - [Obstacle Avoidance](../computer_vision/obstacle_avoidance.md) provides full navigation around obstacles when flying a planned path (currently missions are supported). This uses [PX4/avoidance](https://github.com/PX4/avoidance) running on a companion computer.
  - [Collision Prevention](../computer_vision/collision_prevention.md) is used to stop vehicles before they can crash into an obstacle (primarily when flying in manual modes).
  - [Safe Landing](../computer_vision/safe_landing.md) guides vehicles to find (and land on) flat terrain that is free of stationary obstacles.

:::tip
The [PX4 Vision Autonomy Development Kit](../complete_vehicles/px4_vision_kit.md) (Holybro) is a robust and inexpensive kit for developers working with computer vision on PX4. It comes with [PX4 avoidance](https://github.com/PX4/avoidance#obstacle-detection-and-avoidance) software pre-installed, and can be used as the base for your own algorithms.
