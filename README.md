# PX4 User Guide

This repo contains the source code for the [PX4 User Guide](https://docs.px4.io/en/).  
The guide is intended for people who want to:

* Add PX4-powered controllers to their drones
* Learn how to fly and plan missions using PX4

> **Note:** Developers who want to create new code for PX4 should read the [PX4 Dev Guide](https://dev.px4.io/).
