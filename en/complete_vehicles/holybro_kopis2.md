## Flashing PX4 Bootloader

The *Kopis 2* comes preinstalled with Betaflight.

Before loading PX4 firmware you must first install the PX4 bootloader.
Instructions for installing the bootloader can be found in the [Kakute F7](../flight_controller/kakutef7.md#bootloader) topic (this is the flight controller board on the *Kopis 2*).

:::tip
You can always [reinstall Betaflight](../advanced_config/bootloader_update_from_betaflight.md#reinstall_betaflight) later if you want!
:::

## Installation/Configuration

Once the bootloader is installed, you should be able to connect the vehicle to *QGroundControl* via a USB cable.

:::note
At time of writing *Kopis 2* is supported on the QGroundControl *Daily Build*, and prebuilt firmware is provided for the master branch only (stable releases are not yet available).
:::

To install and configure PX4:
- [Load PX4 Firmware](../config/firmware.md). 
- [Set the Airframe](../config/airframe.md) to *Holybro Kopis 2*.
- Continue with [basic configuration](../config/README.md), including sensor calibration and radio setup.
