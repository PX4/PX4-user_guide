# Complete Vehicles

This section contains information about "complete" vehicles that can PX4.
It lists ready-to-use commercial vehicles, drone "platforms" on which you might base your own development, and kits that you can use to assemble an unmanned vehicle from parts.

:::note
This is a small subset of vehicles that can run PX4.
You can find others on [px4.io](https://px4.io/ecosystem/commercial-systems/) and in the [Airframes Reference](../airframes/airframe_reference.md).

## Drone Development Kits/Reference Platforms

This section lists drone kits that are intended as platforms for further development.
They may come either fully assembled or in parts.

- [PX4 Vision DevKit](../complete_vehicles/px4_vision_kit.md) - Multicopter used for PX4 computer vision development

## UAV Kits

This section list kits that contains all the parts needed for building a PX4-compatible vehicle (with the possible exception of batteries and RC controllers).

:::note
Kits provide a gentler introduction to building drones than starting from individual components.
They allow you to use parts that are known to work, and to fly a vehicle that is appropriately tuned.
