# Lumenier QAV250 Pixhawk & AUAV-X2 Builds

The [Lumenier QAV250 Mini FPV Quadcopter](http://www.lumenier.com/products/multirotors/qav250)
is a small but fully functional FPV multicopter frame. This topic provides
build guidance for using the frame with the *Pixhawk* and AUAV-X2 flight
controllers.

> **Note** Our [Lumenier QAV250 Pixhawk Mini Build](lumenier_qav250_pixhawk_mini.md) contains
  more complete build instructions for working with the QAV250.

Key information:

-   **Frame:** Lumenier QAV250 CF
-   **Flight controller:** Pixhawk or AUAV-X2
-   **Assembly time (approx.):** -

## Frame Assembly

The frame assembly guide is here: [Build
Manual](http://www.lumenier.com/products/multirotors/qav250/build-manual)

## Pixhawk Guidance

There wasn't quite enough room to orient the Pixhawk lengthwise, so I
rotated it 90 degrees and positioned the 4 foam mounting pads as far
apart as possible on the frame. Don't forget to specify the correct
autopilot orientation when you are setting parameters.

The buzzer is mounted to the bottom front of the frame with servo tape
and the safety switch fit neatly in one of the holes at the rear of the
top frame.

To save some weight and make power cabling easier, I removed the XT60
from the output end of the power module and soldered its leads directly
to the PDB.

Flying weight as pictured with 3S/1300mAh Nano-tech LiPo and Mobius
camera, but no FPV gear is 547g and hover throttle is about 50%.

## AUAV-X2 Guidance

The photo below shows the QAV250 with the smaller form-factor AUAV-X2
instead of a Pixhawk.

It is mounted underneath the top plate to move it further away from the
EMI generated by the PDB and ESCs. This allows flight without an
external GPS/compass since the internal compass is usable with the
reduced EMI.

Note that the X2 is mounted in a sintered nylon case with a "baro
chamber" which may be ordered from Phil Kocmoud's Shapeways
store: 
[nylon case (top)](http://www.shapeways.com/product/2HJTU6HNT/auav-x2-r4-screwless-case-top-part-1-of-2?li=more-from-shop&optionId=56908435 "http://www.shapeways.com/product/2HJTU6HNT/auav-x2-r4-screwless-case-top-part-1-of-2?li=more-from-shop&optionId=56908435")

Also note that you must order the top and bottom case halves separately.
The baro chamber reduces sensitivity of the barometer altitude to
pressure effects created by wind and turbulence.
