# MC Filter Tuning & Control Latency

Filters can be used to trade off [control latency](#control-latency), which affects flight performance, and noise filtering, which impacts both flight performance and motor health.

This topic provides an overview of control latency and PX4 filter tuning.

:::note
Before filter tuning you should do a first pass at [Basic MC PID tuning](../config_mc/pid_tuning_guide_multicopter_basic.md).
The vehicle needs to be undertuned (the **P** and **D** gains should be set too low), such that there are no oscillations from the controller that could be interpreted as noise (the default gains might be good enough).
:::

## Control Latency

The *control latency* is the delay from a physical disturbance of the vehicle until the motors react to the change.

:::tip
Lowering latency allows you to increase the rate **P** gains, which results in better flight performance.
Even one millisecond difference in the latency can have a significant impact.
:::

The following factors affect control latency:
- A soft airframe or soft vibration mounting increases latency (they act as a filter).
- Low-pass filters in software and on the sensor chip trade off increased latency for improved noise filtering.
- PX4 software internals: the sensor signals need to be read in the driver and then pass through the controller to the output driver.
- The IO chip (MAIN pins) adds about 5.4 ms latency compared to using the AUX pins (this does not apply to a *Pixracer* or *Omnibus F4*, but does apply to a Pixhawk).
  To avoid the IO delay, disable [SYS_USE_IO](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#SYS_USE_IO) and attach the motors to the AUX pins instead.
- PWM output signal: enable One-Shot to reduce latency ([PWM_RATE](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#PWM_RATE)=0).

Below we look at the impact of the low pass filters.

## Filters

This is the filtering pipeline for the controllers in PX4:
- On-chip DLPF for the gyro sensor.
  This is disabled on all chips where it can be disabled (if not, the cutoff frequency is set to 98Hz and it is sampled at 1kHz).
- Low-pass filter on the gyro sensor data.
  It can be configured with the [IMU_GYRO_CUTOFF](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#IMU_GYRO_CUTOFF) parameter.
  :::note
  Sampling and filtering is always performed at the full raw sensor rate (commonly 8Hz).
  :::
- A separate low-pass filter on the D-term.
  The D-term is most susceptible to noise while slightly increased latency does not negatively affect performance.
  For this reason the D-term has a separately-configurable low-pass filter, [IMU_DGYRO_CUTOFF](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#IMU_DGYRO_CUTOFF).
- A slewrate filter on the motor outputs ([MOT_SLEW_MAX](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#MOT_SLEW_MAX)).
  Generally not used.

To reduce the control latency, we want to increase the cutoff frequency for the low-pass filters.
The effect on latency of increasing `IMU_GYRO_CUTOFF` is approximated below.

Cuttoff (Hz) | Delay approx. (ms)
--- | ---
30 | 8
60 | 3.8
120 | 1.9

However this is a trade-off as increasing `IMU_GYRO_CUTOFF` will also increase the noise of the signal that is fed to the motors.
Noise on the motors has the following consequences:
- Motors and ESCs can get hot, to the point where they get damaged.
- Reduced flight time because the motors continuously change their speed.
- Visible random small twitches.

The best filter settings depend on the vehicle.
The defaults are set conservatively â€” such that they work on lower-quality setups as well.

## Filter Tuning

First make sure to have the high-rate logging profile activated ([SDLOG_PROFILE](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#SDLOG_PROFILE) parameter).
[Flight Review](../getting_started/flight_reporting.md) will then show an FFT plot for the roll, pitch and yaw controls.

:::warning
Do not try to fix a vehicle that suffers from high vibrations with filter tuning!
Instead:
- Confirm that PID gains, in particular D, are not set too high as this can show up as vibrations.
- Fix the vehicle hardware setup.
:::

Filter tuning is best done by reviewing flight logs.
You can do multiple flights right after each other with different parameters and then inspect all logs, but make sure to disarm in between so that separate log files are created.

The performed flight maneuver can simply be hovering in [Manual/Stabilized mode](../flight_modes/manual_stabilized_mc.md) with some rolling and pitching to all directions and some increased throttle periods.
The total duration does not need to be more than 30 seconds.
In order to better compare, the maneuver should be similar in all tests.

First tune the gyro filter [IMU_GYRO_CUTOFF](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#IMU_GYRO_CUTOFF) by increasing it in steps of 10 Hz while using a low D-term filter value ([IMU_DGYRO_CUTOFF](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#IMU_DGYRO_CUTOFF) = 30).
Upload the logs to https://logs.px4.io and compare the *Actuator Controls FFT* plot.
Set the cutoff frequency to a value before the noise starts to increase noticeably (for frequencies around and above 60 Hz).
Then tune the D-term filter (`IMU_DGYRO_CUTOFF`) in the same way.

Below is an example for three different filter values (40Hz, 70Hz, 90Hz).
At 90 Hz the general noise level starts to increase (especially for roll), and thus a cutoff frequency of 70 Hz is a safe setting.

![IMU_DGYRO_CUTOFF=90](../../assets/airframes/multicopter/racer_setup/actuator_controls_fft_dgyrocutoff_90.png)

:::note
The plot cannot be compared between different vehicles, as the y axis scale can be different.
On the same vehicle it is consistent and independent of the flight duration.
