# Flight Reporting

Keeping flight logs is a legal requirement in some jurisdictions. PX4 logs detailed aircraft performance data once the system has been armed until it is disarmed.

These flight logs can also be used to analyze performance issues.

## Downloading Logs from the Flight Controller

Please ensure to use a recent version of QGroundControl, at minimum v3.2, which is available as a [preview build here](https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/en/releases/daily_builds.html).
