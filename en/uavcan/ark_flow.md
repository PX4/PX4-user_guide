### Wiring/Connecting

The ARK Flow is connected to the CAN bus using a Pixhawk standard 4 pin JST GH cable.
Multiple sensors can be connected by plugging additional sensors into the ARK Flow's second CAN connector.

General instructions for UAVCAN wiring can also be found in [UAVCAN > Wiring](../uavcan/README.md#wiring).

### Mounting/Orientation

The recommended mounting orientation is with the connectors on the board pointing towards **back of vehicle**, as shown in the following picture.

![ARK Flow align with Pixhawk](../../assets/hardware/sensors/optical_flow/ark_flow_orientation.png)

This corresponds to the default value (`0`) of the parameter [SENS_FLOW_ROT](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#SENS_FLOW_ROT).
Change the parameter appropriately if using a different orientation.

The sensor can be mounted anywhere on the frame, but you will need to specify the focal point position, relative to vehicle centre of gravity, during [PX4 configuration](#px4-configuration).


## PX4 Setup

### Enabling UAVCAN

In order to use the ARK Flow board, connect it to the Pixhawk CAN bus and enable the UAVCAN driver by setting parameter [UAVCAN_ENABLE](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#UAVCAN_ENABLE) to `2` for dynamic node allocation (or `3` if using [UAVCAN ESCs](../uavcan/escs.md)).

The steps are:
- In *QGroundControl* set the parameter [UAVCAN_ENABLE](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#UAVCAN_ENABLE) to `2` or `3` and reboot (see [Finding/Updating Parameters](../advanced_config/parameters.md)).
- Connect ARK Flow CAN to the Pixhawk CAN.

Once enabled, the module will be detected on boot.
Flow data should arrive at 10Hz.

### PX4 Configuration

Set the EKF optical flow parameters in [Optical Flow > Estimators > EKF2](../sensor/optical_flow.md#ekf2) in order to:
- enable fusing optical flow measurements for velocity calculation.
- define offsets if the sensor is not centred within the vehicle.

In addition you may need to configure the following parameters.

Parameter | Description
--- | ---
<span id="SENS_FLOW_MAXHGT"></span>[SENS_FLOW_MAXHGT](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#SENS_FLOW_MAXHGT) | Maximum height above ground when reliant on optical flow.
<span id="SENS_FLOW_MINHGT"></span>[SENS_FLOW_MINHGT](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#SENS_FLOW_MINHGT) | Minimum height above ground when reliant on optical flow.
<span id="SENS_FLOW_MAXR"></span>[SENS_FLOW_MAXR](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#SENS_FLOW_MAXR) | Maximum angular flow rate reliably measurable by the optical flow sensor.
<span id="SENS_FLOW_ROT"></span>[SENS_FLOW_ROT](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#SENS_FLOW_ROT) | Yaw rotation of the board relative to the vehicle body frame.


## Building Ark Flow Firmware

Ark Flow is sold with a recent firmware build.
Developers who want to update to the very latest version can build and install it themselves using the normal PX4 toolchain and sources.

The steps are:
1. Install the [PX4 toolchain](../dev_setup/dev_env.md). 
1. Clone the PX4-Autopilot sources, including Ark Flow, using *git*:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot --recursive
   cd PX4-Autopilot
   ```
1. Build the *Ark Flow* firmware:
   ```
   make ark_can-flow
   ```
1. Follow instructions for [UAVCAN firmware updating](node_firmware.md) using the binary located in **build/ark_can-flow_default** named **XX-X.X.XXXXXXXX.uavcan.bin**.
