# UAVCAN Development

### Debugging with Zubax Babel

A great tool to debug the transmission on the UAVCAN bus is the [Zubax Babel](https://zubax.com/products/babel) in combination with the [GUI tool](http://uavcan.org/GUI_Tool/Overview/).

They can also be used independently from Pixhawk hardware in order to test a node or manually control UAVCAN enabled ESCs.
