# UAVCAN Development

This topic/section has information that is relevant to developers who want to add support for new [UAVCAN](http://uavcan.org) hardware to the PX4 Autopilot.

:::note
[Hardware > UAVCAN Peripherals](../uavcan/README.md) contains information about using existing/supported UAVCAN components with PX4.

## Upgrading Node Firmware

The PX4 middleware will automatically upgrade firmware on UAVCAN nodes if the matching firmware is supplied.
The process and requirements are described on the [UAVCAN Firmware](../uavcan/node_firmware.md) page.

### Debugging with Zubax Babel

A great tool to debug the transmission on the UAVCAN bus is the [Zubax Babel](https://zubax.com/products/babel) in combination with the [GUI tool](http://uavcan.org/GUI_Tool/Overview/).

They can also be used independently from Pixhawk hardware in order to test a node or manually control UAVCAN enabled ESCs.
