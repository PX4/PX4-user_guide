# Holybro PM02D Power Module

This digital power module provides regulated power to flight controller and power distribution board, and sends information to the autopilot about battery voltage and current supplied to the flight controller and the motors.

The power module is connected using the I2C protocol.
It is designed for flight controllers based on the Pixhawk FMUv5X and FMUv6X open standard, including the [Pixhawk 5X](../flight_controller/pixhawk5x.md).

:::note
The PM is **NOT** compatible with flight controllers that require an analog power module, including: [Pixhawk 4](../flight_controller/pixhawk4.md), [Durandal](../flight_controller/durandal.md), [Pix32 v5](../flight_controller/holybro_pix32_v5.md), etc.
