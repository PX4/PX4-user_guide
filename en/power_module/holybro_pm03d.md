# Holybro Pixhawk 4 Power Module (PM03D)

This board serves the purpose of a Power Module as well as a Power Distribution Board.

In addition to providing regulated power to Pixhawk 5X and the ESCs, it sends information to the autopilot about batteryâ€™s voltage and current supplied to the flight controller and the motors.

:::note
This power module using digital I2C protocol for voltage and current monitoring that is designed for flight controller based on FMUv5X & FMUv6X open standard such as the [Pixhawk 5X](../flight_controller/pixhawk5x.md).
It is **NOT** compatible with flight controller that uses analog power module like the [Pixhawk 4](../flight_controller/pixhawk4.md), [Durandal](../flight_controller/durandal.md), [Pix32 v5](../flight_controller/holybro_pix32_v5.md), etc.
