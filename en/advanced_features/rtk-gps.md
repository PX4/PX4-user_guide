# RTK GPS

[Real Time Kinematic (RTK)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_Kinematic) GNSS/GPS systems provide centimeter-level accuracy, allowing PX4 to be used in applications like precision surveying (where pinpoint accuracy is essential).
This feature requires *QGroundControl* running on a laptop/PC and a vehicle with a WiFi or Telemetry radio link to the ground station laptop.

In addition, some RTK setups can provide heading from GPS, which can be used as an alternative to the compass.

Information about supported devices and setup can be found in the section: [Peripheral Hardware > RTK GPS](../gps_compass/rtk_gps.md).
