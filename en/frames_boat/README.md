# Boats (USV)

:::warning
Support for boats is _experimental_.

- The frame does not support all features needed in a product-quality UUV (feature support not known/documented).
- The frame is not regularly tested by the core development team.
:::

PX4 supports every imaginable plane geometry, including normal planes, flying wings, inverted V-tail planes etc.
The complete set of supported configurations can be seen in [Airframes Reference > Plane](../airframes/airframe_reference.md#plane).
