# PMW3901 Flow Sensor

PMW3901 is an [optical flow](../sensor/optical_flow.md) asic that computes the flow internally and provides a difference in pixels between each frame over an SPI interface.
It is basically a tracking sensor similar to what you would find in a computer mouse, but adapted to work between 80 mm and infinity.
The sensor can be read at a frequency up to 100 Hz.
The PMW3901 is used in a number of products including Bitcraze, Tindie, Hex and Thone - see full listing below.

The following is a video of an S500 frame with a Pixhawk 4 and the Bitcraze PMW3901 flow deck. GPS was fully disabled in this test to see the real performance of the flow module.

## Boards using PMW3901

The following table shows some of the boards available on the market with the pmw3901 optical flow sensor.
The number interfaces, the number of sensors, the input voltage and the size are shown.
The board name contains the link to where to buy the specific board.

Board | Interface | Flow | Range Finder | Gyro | Voltage (V) | Size (mm) | Max Height (m)

For boards that don't have a range finder such as the Tindie or Thone and external range finder is required.
With the other two boards the range is quite limited therefore and external range finder is also advised.

## Pixhawk Setup

### Bitcraze

The Bitcraze optical flow module exposes directly the SPI interface from the PMW3901 module.
The board also has a distance sensor that can be wired via I2C.
This distance sensor is the VL53L0x ToF sensor from STMicroelectronics.
The range of the sensor is very limited (2 meters) and will be reduced when flying in the sunlight.
We therefore highly recommend to use another external distance sensor.
This board was mainly tested with the [Lidar Lite V3](../sensor/lidar_lite.md) on larger vehicles and with the [Lanbao CM8JL65](../sensor/cm8jl65_ir_distance_sensor.md) on smaller vehicles.
The range needed is dependent on the application.
When flying indoors, generally 4 meters height are enough.
If optical flow is also needed outdoors to support the position control in environments where GPS might have issues, then more range is advised (10 meters or more).

The PMW3901 driver was written to be directly plugged into the SPI port on the Pixhawk 4 using the chip select 1.
The support for this driver on other boards can then easily be exteded to other boards by modifying the SPI_BUS and the SPI_DEV in the PMW3901 driver.
The following diagram shows how to wire the sensor to a Pixhawk 4.

When plugged into the SPI port of the Pixhawk 4, the Bitcraze flow module will be automatically detected at bootup.
No parameters will have to configured, unless you decide to change the orientation of the sensor.
This will be explained later in this section together with some diagrams to show the default orientation of the sensor.

### Tindie

The Tindie optical flow module exposes the SPI interface from the PMW3901 module exactly as on the Bitcraze module.
The only difference here is the size of the board and the fact that this module doesn't have a distance sensor onboard.
Unlike the Bitcraze module where you could try to use the onboard distance sensor, with this one it is mandatory to use one of the [distance sensors](../sensor/rangefinders.md) supported by PX4.

### Hex

The Hex optical flow module is a very small board containing the PMW3901 flow module, the VL53L1X distance sensor and an IMU to better synchronize the flow data with the gyro data.
These three sensors are then sampled by a microcontroller onboard.
The goal of the microcontroller is to then expose 2 UAVCAN messages containing all the necessary data.

This board can be connected to the CAN port on any Pixhawk board.
All tests were performed connecting it to the CAN1 port on a Pixhawk 4.
Differently from the other sensors, this one needs UAVCAN running on PX4.
To enable UAVCAN you will have to set the UAVCAN_ENABLE parameter to 2 (if you have have UAVCAN sensors but no motor controllers) or to 3 (if you have also your motor controllers on CAN).

As for the other optical flow boards, it is recommended to use an external distance sensor instead of the onboard one due to the limited range of the VL53L1X.

Regarding rotations, also this board will have a default orientation and if necessary this could be modified through a parameter.

### Thone
WORK IN PROGRESS

## Mounting/Orientation

Each one of the mentioned optical flow sensors has a default orientation which can then be modified by varying the SENS_FLOW_ROT.
By default this parameter is set to YAW 270 due to historical reasons with the PX4FLOW sensor.
With the SENS_FLOW_ROT set to 0 the PMW3901 will have to be rotated in such a way where the small notch on the chip will be facing towards the back of the vehicle - see diagram below.
