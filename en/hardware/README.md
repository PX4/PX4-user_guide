# Hardware

This section contains topics about:

* Modifying PX4 to work with _new_ [flight controller hardware](../hardware/porting_guide.md) and [vehicles/airframes](../airframes/README.md)
* Integrating new [sensors and actuators](../sensor_bus/README.md), [telemetry radio](../data_links/telemetry.md), and other peripherals. 

> **Tip** The rest of the PX4 User Guide contains topics about using and configuring _existing/supported_ hardware.
