# Smart Batteries

Smart Batteries keep track of the state of the battery, including its exact state of charge, cell voltages, time-to-empty, and temperature readings. This allows for easier flight planning and more accurate prediction of failure conditions: [Safety > Low Battery Failsafe](../config/safety.md#low-battery-failsafe).
