# Windows Installation Instructions

To develop for PX4 on Windows, follow the instructions in [Windows Cygwin Toolchain](../dev_setup/dev_env_windows_cygwin.md).

:::tip
The *Cygwin toolchain* supports building for NuttX/Pixhawk and jMAVSim simulator targets.
If you want to build for [other targets](../dev_setup/dev_env.md#supported-targets), consider setting up a dual boot system with [Ubuntu Linux](http://ubuntu.com).
:::

## Next Steps

Once you have finished setting up the command-line toolchain:
- Install [VSCode](../dev_setup/vscode.md) (if you prefer using an IDE to the command line).
- Install the [QGroundControl Daily Build](https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/en/releases/daily_builds.html)
  :::tip
  The *daily build* includes development tools that hidden in release builds. 
  It may also provide access to new PX4 features that are not yet supported in release builds.
  :::
- Continue to the [build instructions](../dev_setup/building_px4.md).


## Other Windows Toolchains

There are a number of other legacy/alternative solutions that may be of interest to some developers. 
A comparison of the options is provided below.

:::note
The [Cygwin Toolchain](../dev_setup/dev_env_windows_cygwin.md) is the only one that is supported by the PX4 dev team.
It is regularly tested as part of our continuous integration system and is known to be better performing than the other alternatives.
