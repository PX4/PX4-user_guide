# Development Environment on Mac

MacOS is a supported development platform for PX4. The following instructions set up an environment for building:
* NuttX-based hardware (Pixhawk, etc.)
* jMAVSim Smulation
* Gazebo Simulation

To build other targets see: [Toolchain Installation > Supported Targets](../dev_setup/dev_env.md#supported-targets).

:::tip
If you have an Apple M1 Macbook, make sure to run the terminal as x86 by setting up an x86 terminal:
1. Locate the Terminal application within the Utilities folder (Finder > Go menu > Utilities)
2. Select Terminal.app and right-click on it, then choose “Duplicate”
3. Rename the duplicated Terminal app, e.g. `x86 Terminal`
4. Now select the renamed `x86 Terminal` app and right-click and choose “Get Info”
5. Check the box for “Open using Rosetta”, then close the window
6. Run the `x86 Terminal` as usual, which will fully support the current PX4 toolchain

## Homebrew Installation

The installation of Homebrew is quick and easy: [installation instructions](https://brew.sh).

## Enable more open files (Handle "LD: too many open files" error)

Create the `~/.zshenv` file or append it (by running `open ~/.zshenv` on the terminal) and add this line:
```sh
ulimit -S -n 2048
```

## Enforce Python Version

If not already existing, create the file `~/.zshrc` and add these lines:

```sh
# Point pip3 to MacOS system python 3 pip
alias pip3=/usr/bin/pip3
```

## Common Tools

After installing Homebrew, run these commands in your shell to install the common tools:

```sh
brew tap PX4/px4
brew install px4-dev
```
Install the required Python packages

```sh
# install required packages using pip3
python3 -m pip install --user pyserial empy toml numpy pandas jinja2 pyyaml pyros-genmsg packaging
# if this fails with a permissions error, your Python install is in a system path - use this command instead:
sudo -H python3 -m pip install --user pyserial empy toml numpy pandas jinja2 pyyaml pyros-genmsg packaging
```

## Gazebo Simulation

To install SITL simulation with Gazebo:

```sh
brew install --cask xquartz
brew install px4-sim-gazebo
```

## jMAVSim Simulation

To use SITL simulation with jMAVSim you need to install a recent version of Java (e.g. Java 14).
You can either download [Java 14 from Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk14-downloads.html) or use the AdoptOpenJDK tap:

```sh
brew tap AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk
brew install --cask adoptopenjdk14
```

```sh
brew install px4-sim-jmavsim
```

:::note
jMAVSim for PX4 v1.11 and earlier required Java 8.

## Additional Tools

See [Additional Tools](../dev_setup/generic_dev_tools.md) for information about other useful development tools that are not part of the build toolchain (for example IDEs and GCSs).

## Next Steps

Once you have finished setting up the environment, continue to the [build instructions](../dev_setup/building_px4.md).
