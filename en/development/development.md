# PX4 Development

This user guide has everything you need to fly, assemble and configure a vehicle that uses one of the *many supported* airframes, flight controllers and peripherals.

Developers who want to modify flight algorithms, add new modes, integrate new hardware, communicate with PX4 from outside the flight controller, or contribute to PX4 will need to read 
the [PX4 Development Guide](http://dev.px4.io/).
