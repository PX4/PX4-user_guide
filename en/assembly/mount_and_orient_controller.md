# Mounting the Flight Controller

## Orientation

Almost all Flight Controllers have a *heading mark arrow* (shown below).
The controller should be placed on the frame top-side up, oriented so that the arrow points towards the front of the vehicle (on all aircraft frames - airplane, multirotor, VTOL, ground vehicles etc.).

> **Note** If the controller cannot be mounted in the recommended/default orientationÂ (e.g. due to physical constraints) you will need to configure the autopilot software with the orientation that you actually used: [Flight Controller Orientation](../config/flight_controller_orientation.md).

## Vibration Isolation

Flight Control boards with in-built accelerometers or gyros are sensitive to vibrations.
Some boards include in-built vibration-isolation, while others come with *mounting foam* that you can use to isolate the controller from the vehicle.

*Vibration damping foam*

You should use the mounting strategy recommended in your flight controller documentation.

> **Tip** [Log Analysis using Flight Review > Vibration](../log/flight_review.md#vibration) explains how to test whether vibration levels are acceptable, and [Vibration Isolation](../assembly/vibration_isolation.md) suggests a number of possible solutions if there is a problem.
