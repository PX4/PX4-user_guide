# Robotics using ROS

[ROS](http://www.ros.org/) (Robot Operating System) is a general purpose robotics library that can be used with PX4 for [offboard control](../ros/mavros_offboard.md).
It uses the [MAVROS](../ros/mavros_installation.md) node to communicate with PX4 running on hardware or using the [Gazebo Simulator](../simulation/ros_interface.md).

This section contains topics about using ROS for offboard control with PX4.

:::tip
ROS is only officially supported on Linux platforms.

## Installation

The easiest way to setup PX4 simulation with ROS (on Ubuntu Linux) is to use the standard installation script that can be found at [Development Environment on Linux > Gazebo with ROS](../dev_setup/dev_env_linux_ubuntu.md#rosgazebo).
The script installs everything you need: PX4, ROS, the Gazebo simulator, and [MAVROS](../ros/mavros_installation.md).

:::note
If you just need to install ROS then follow the [ROS Melodic installation instructions](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation) for your platform.
