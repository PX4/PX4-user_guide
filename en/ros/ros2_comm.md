# ROS 2 User Guide

The ROS2-PX4 architecture provides a deep integration between ROS 2 and PX4, allowing ROS 2 subscribers or publisher nodes to interface directly with PX4 uORB topics.

This topic provides an overview of the architecture and application pipeline, and explains how to setup and use ROS 2 with PX4.

## Overview

The application pipeline for ROS 2 is very straightforward, thanks to the use of the [XRCE-DDS](../middleware/xrce_dds.md) communications middleware.

![Architecture XRCE-DDS with ROS 2](../../assets/middleware/xrce_dds/architecture_xrce-dds_ros2.svg)

<!-- doc source: https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1WcJOU-EcVOZRPQwNzMEKJecShii2G4U3yhA3U6C4EhE/edit?usp=sharing -->

The XRCE-DDS middleware consists of a client running on PX4 and an agent running on the companion computer, with bi-directional data exchange between them over a serial, UDP, TCP or custom link.
The agent acts as a proxy for the client to publish and subscribe to topics in the global DDS data space.

The PX4 [microdds-client](../modules/modules_system.md#microdds-client) is generated at build time and included in PX4 firmare by default.
It includes both the "generic" XRCE-DDS client code, and PX4-specific translation code that it uses to publish to/from uORB topics.
The subset of uORB messages that are generated into the client are listed in [PX4-Autopilot/src/modules/microdds_client/dds_topics.yaml](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/main/src/modules/microdds_client/dds_topics.yaml).
The generator uses the uORB message definitions in the source tree: [PX4-Autopilot/msg](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/tree/main/msg) to create the code for sending ROS 2 messages.

ROS 2 applications need to be built in a workspace that has the _same_ message definitions that were used to create the XRCE-DDS client module in the PX4 Firmware.
You can include these by cloning the [PX4/px4_msgs](https://github.com/PX4/px4_msgs) into your ROS2 workspace (branches in the repo correspond to the messages for different PX4 releases).

Note that the XRCE-DDS _agent_ itself has no dependency on client-side code.
It can be built from [source](https://github.com/eProsima/Micro-XRCE-DDS-Agent) either standalone or as part of a ROS build, or installed as a snap.

You will normally need to start both the client and agent when using ROS 2.
Note that the XRCE-DDS client is built into firmware by default but not started automatically except for simulator builds.

:::note
In PX4v1.13 and earlier, ROS 2 was dependent on definitions in [px4_ros_com](https://github.com/PX4/px4_ros_com).
This repo is no longer needed, but does contain useful examples.
:::


## Installation & Setup

The supported platform for PX4 development is Ubuntu 20.04 (at time of writing), which means that you should use ROS2 "Foxy".

:::warning
Other platforms, such as Ubuntu 22.04 and ROS 2 "Humble", may work, but are not fully tested and officially supported by the PX4 dev team. <!-- Windows/Mac? -->
:::

To setup ROS 2 for use with PX4 you will need to:

- [Install PX4](#install-px4) (to use the PX4 simulator)
- [Install ROS2](#install-ros-2)
- [Setup XRCE-DDS Agent & Client](#setup-xrce-dds-agent-client)
- [Build & Run ROS 2 Workspace](#build-ros-2-workspace)

Other dependencies of the architecture that are installed automatically, such as _Fast DDS_, are not covered.

### Install PX4

You need to install the PX4 development toolchain in order to use the simulator.

:::note
The only dependency ROS2 has on PX4 is the set of message definitions, which it gets from [px4_msgs](https://github.com/PX4/px4_msgs).
You only need to install PX4 if you need the simulator (as we do in this guide), or if you are creating a build that publishes custom uORB topics.
:::

Set up a PX4 development environment on Ubuntu in the normal way:

1. [Setup the development environment for Ubuntu](../dev_setup/dev_env_linux_ubuntu.md)
1. [Download PX4 source](../dev_setup/building_px4.md)


### Install ROS 2

To install ROS 2 and its dependencies:

1. [Install ROS 2 Foxy](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Foxy/Linux-Install-Debians/)
   - You can install _either_ the desktop (`ros-foxy-desktop`) or bare-bones (`ros-foxy-ros-base`) version
   - You should additionally install the development tools (`ros-dev-tools`)
1. Some Python dependencies must also be installed (using **`pip`** or **`apt`**):

   ```sh
   sudo pip3 install -U empy pyros-genmsg setuptools
   ```

### Setup XRCE-DDS Agent & Client

For ROS 2 to communicate with PX4, a XRCE-DDS client must be running on PX4, connected to an XRCE-DDS agent running on the companion computer.

#### Setup the Agent

The agent can be installed onto the companion computer in a [number of ways](../middleware/xrce_dds.md#xrce-dds-agent-installation-usage).
Below we show how to build the agent "standalone" from source and connect to a client running on the PX4 simulator.

To setup and start the agent:

1. Open a terminal.
1. Enter the following commands to fetch and build the agent from source:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/eProsima/Micro-XRCE-DDS-Agent.git
   cd Micro-XRCE-DDS-Agent
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   sudo make install
   sudo ldconfig /usr/local/lib/
   ```

1. Start the agent with settings for connecting to the XRCE-DDS client running on the simulator: 

   ```sh
   MicroXRCEAgent udp4 -p 8888
   ```

The agent is now running, but you won't see much until we start PX4 (in the next step).

:::note
You can leave the agent running in this terminal!
Note that only one agent is allowed per connection channel.
:::

#### Start the Client

The PX4 simulator starts the XRCE-DDS client automatically, connecting to UDP port 8888 on the local host.

To start the simulator (and client):

1. Open a new terminal in the root of the **PX4 Autopilot** repo that was installed above.
1. Start a PX4 [Gazebo Classic](../sim_gazebo_classic/README.md) simulation using:

   ```sh
   make px4_sitl gazebo-classic
   ```
   
The agent and client are now running they should connect.

The PX4 terminal displays the [NuttShell/PX4 System Console](../debug/system_console.md) output as PX4 boots and runs.
As soon as the agent connects the output should include `INFO` messages showing creation of data writers:
   
```
...
INFO  [microdds_client] synchronized with time offset 1675929429203524us
INFO  [microdds_client] successfully created rt/fmu/out/failsafe_flags data writer, topic id: 83
INFO  [microdds_client] successfully created rt/fmu/out/sensor_combined data writer, topic id: 168
INFO  [microdds_client] successfully created rt/fmu/out/timesync_status data writer, topic id: 188
...
```

The XRCE-DDS agent terminal should also start to show output, as equivalent topics are created in the DDS network:

```
...
[1675929445.268957] info     | ProxyClient.cpp    | create_publisher         | publisher created      | client_key: 0x00000001, publisher_id: 0x0DA(3), participant_id: 0x001(1)
[1675929445.269521] info     | ProxyClient.cpp    | create_datawriter        | datawriter created     | client_key: 0x00000001, datawriter_id: 0x0DA(5), publisher_id: 0x0DA(3)

...
```

### Build ROS 2 Workspace

This section shows how create a ROS 2 workspace hosted in your home directory (modify the commands as needed to put the source code elsewhere).

The [px4_ros_com](https://github.com/PX4/px4_ros_com) and [px4_msgs](https://github.com/PX4/px4_msgs) packages are cloned to a workspace folder, and then the `colcon` tool is used to build the workspace.
The example is run using `ros2 launch`.

:::note
The example builds the [ROS 2 Listener](#ros-2-listener) example application, located in [px4_ros_com](https://github.com/PX4/px4_ros_com).
[px4_msgs](https://github.com/PX4/px4_msgs) is needed too so that the example can interpret PX4 ROS 2 topics.
:::


#### Building the Workspace

To create and build the workspace:

1. Open a new terminal.
1. Create and navigate into a new workspace directory using:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/ws_sensor_combined/src/
   cd ~/ws_sensor_combined/src/
   ```

   :::note
   A naming convention for workspace folders can make it easier to manage workspaces.
   :::

1. Clone the example repository and [px4_msgs](https://github.com/PX4/px4_msgs) to the `/src` directory (the `main` branch is cloned by default, which corresponds to the the version of PX4 we are running):

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/PX4/px4_msgs.git
   git clone https://github.com/PX4/px4_ros_com.git
   ```

1. Source the ROS2 development environment ("foxy") into the current terminal and compile the workspace using `colcon`:

   ```sh
   cd ..
   source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
   colcon build
   ```

   This builds all the folders under `/src` using the "foxy" toolchain.

#### Running the Example

To run the executables that you just built, you need to source `local_setup.bash`.
This provides access to the "environment hooks" for the current workspace.
In other words, it makes the executables that were just built available in the current terminal.

In the same terminal:

1. Source the `local_setup.bash` (you should also source `setup.bash` if in a new terminal).

   ```sh
   source install/local_setup.bash
   ```
1. Now launch the example.
   Note here that we use `ros2 launch`, which is described below.

   ```
   ros2 launch px4_ros_com sensor_combined_listener.launch.py
   ```

If this is working you should see data being printed on the terminal/console where you launched the ROS listener:

```sh
RECEIVED DATA FROM SENSOR COMBINED
================================
ts: 870938190
gyro_rad[0]: 0.00341645
gyro_rad[1]: 0.00626475
gyro_rad[2]: -0.000515705
gyro_integral_dt: 4739
accelerometer_timestamp_relative: 0
accelerometer_m_s2[0]: -0.273381
accelerometer_m_s2[1]: 0.0949186
accelerometer_m_s2[2]: -9.76044
accelerometer_integral_dt: 4739
```

## Controlling a Vehicle

To control applications, ROS2 applications:

- subscribe to (listen to) telemetry topics published by PX4
- publish to topics that cause PX4 to perform some action.

The topics that you can use are defined in [dds_topics.yaml](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/main/src/modules/microdds_client/dds_topics.yaml), and you can get more information about their data in the [uORB Message Reference](../msg_docs/README.md).
For example, [vehicle_global_position](../msg_docs/vehicle_global_position.md) can be used to get the vehicle global position, while [vehicle_command](../msg_docs/vehicle_command.md) can be used to command actions such as takeoff and land.

The [ROS 2 Example applications](#ros-2-example-applications) examples below provide concrete examples of how to use these topics.

## Compatibility Issues

This section contains information that may affect how you write your ROS code.

### ROS2 Subscriber QoS Settings

ROS2 code that subscribes to topics published by PX4 _must_ specify a appropriate (compatible) QoS setting in order to listen to topics.
Specifically, nodes should subscribe using the ROS2 predefined QoS sensor data (from the [listener example source code](#ros-2-listener)):

```cpp
...
rmw_qos_profile_t qos_profile = rmw_qos_profile_sensor_data;
auto qos = rclcpp::QoS(rclcpp::QoSInitialization(qos_profile.history, 5), qos_profile);

subscription_ = this->create_subscription<px4_msgs::msg::SensorCombined>("/fmu/out/sensor_combined", qos,
...
```

This is needed because the ROS2 default [Quality of Service (QoS) settings](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Concepts/About-Quality-of-Service-Settings.html#qos-profiles) are different from the settings used by PX4.
Not all combinations of publisher-subscriber [Qos settings are possible](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Concepts/About-Quality-of-Service-Settings.html#qos-compatibilities), and it turns out that the default ROS2 settings for subscribing are not!
Note that ROS code does not have to set QoS settings when publishing (the PX4 settings are compatible with ROS defaults in this case).

<!-- From https://github.com/PX4/PX4-user_guide/pull/2259#discussion_r1099788316 -->


## ROS 2 Example Applications

### ROS 2 Listener

The ROS 2 [listener examples](https://github.com/PX4/px4_ros_com/tree/main/src/examples/listeners) in the [px4_ros_com](https://github.com/PX4/px4_ros_com) repo demonstrate how to write ROS nodes to listen to topics published by PX4.

Here we consider the [sensor_combined_listener.cpp](https://github.com/PX4/px4_ros_com/blob/main/src/examples/listeners/sensor_combined_listener.cpp) node under `px4_ros_com/src/examples/listeners`, which subscribes to the [sensor_combined](../msg_docs/sensor_combined.md#sensor-combined-uorb-message) message.

:::note
[Build ROS2 Workspace](#build-ros-2-workspace) shows how to build and run this example.
:::

The code first imports the C++ libraries needed to interface with the ROS 2 middleware and the header file for the `sensor_combined` message to which the node subscribes:

```cpp
#include <rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp>
#include <px4_msgs/msg/sensor_combined.hpp>
```

Then it creates a `SensorCombinedListener` class that subclasses the generic `rclcpp::Node` base class.

```cpp
/**
 * @brief Sensor Combined uORB topic data callback
 */
class SensorCombinedListener : public rclcpp::Node
{
```

This creates a callback function for when the `sensor_combined` uORB messages are received (now as XRCE-DDS messages), and outputs the content of the message fields each time the message is received.

```cpp
public:
	explicit SensorCombinedListener() : Node("sensor_combined_listener")
	{
		rmw_qos_profile_t qos_profile = rmw_qos_profile_sensor_data;
		auto qos = rclcpp::QoS(rclcpp::QoSInitialization(qos_profile.history, 5), qos_profile);
		
		subscription_ = this->create_subscription<px4_msgs::msg::SensorCombined>("/fmu/out/sensor_combined", qos,
		[this](const px4_msgs::msg::SensorCombined::UniquePtr msg) {
			std::cout << "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n";
			std::cout << "RECEIVED SENSOR COMBINED DATA"   << std::endl;
			std::cout << "============================="   << std::endl;
			std::cout << "ts: "          << msg->timestamp    << std::endl;
			std::cout << "gyro_rad[0]: " << msg->gyro_rad[0]  << std::endl;
			std::cout << "gyro_rad[1]: " << msg->gyro_rad[1]  << std::endl;
			std::cout << "gyro_rad[2]: " << msg->gyro_rad[2]  << std::endl;
			std::cout << "gyro_integral_dt: " << msg->gyro_integral_dt << std::endl;
			std::cout << "accelerometer_timestamp_relative: " << msg->accelerometer_timestamp_relative << std::endl;
			std::cout << "accelerometer_m_s2[0]: " << msg->accelerometer_m_s2[0] << std::endl;
			std::cout << "accelerometer_m_s2[1]: " << msg->accelerometer_m_s2[1] << std::endl;
			std::cout << "accelerometer_m_s2[2]: " << msg->accelerometer_m_s2[2] << std::endl;
			std::cout << "accelerometer_integral_dt: " << msg->accelerometer_integral_dt << std::endl;
		});
	}
```

:::note
The subscription sets a QoS profile based on `rmw_qos_profile_sensor_data`.
This is needed because the default ROS2 QoS profile for subscribers is incompatible with the PX4 profile for publishers.
For more information see: [ROS2 Subscriber QoS Settings](#ros2-subscriber-qos-settings),
:::

The lines below create a publisher to the `sensor_combined` uORB topic, which can be matched with one or more compatible ROS2 subscribers to the `fmu/sensor_combined/out` ROS2 topic.

```cpp
private:
	rclcpp::Subscription<px4_msgs::msg::SensorCombined>::SharedPtr subscription_;
};
```

The instantiation of the `SensorCombinedListener` class as a ROS node is done on the `main` function.

```cpp
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	std::cout << "Starting sensor_combined listener node..." << std::endl;
	setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IONBF, BUFSIZ);
	rclcpp::init(argc, argv);
	rclcpp::spin(std::make_shared<SensorCombinedListener>());

	rclcpp::shutdown();
	return 0;
}
```

This particular example has an associated launch file at [launch/sensor_combined_listener.launch.py](https://github.com/PX4/px4_ros_com/blob/main/launch/sensor_combined_listener.launch.py). 
This allows it to be launched using the [`ros2 launch`](#ros2-launch) command.

### ROS 2 Advertiser

A ROS 2 advertiser node publishes data into the DDS/RTPS network (and hence to the PX4 Autopilot).

Taking as an example the `debug_vect_advertiser.cpp` under `px4_ros_com/src/advertisers`, first we import required headers, including the `debug_vect` msg header.

```cpp
#include <chrono>
#include <rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp>
#include <px4_msgs/msg/debug_vect.hpp>

using namespace std::chrono_literals;
```

Then the code creates a `DebugVectAdvertiser` class that subclasses the generic `rclcpp::Node` base class.

```cpp
class DebugVectAdvertiser : public rclcpp::Node
{
```

The code below creates a function for when messages are to be sent.
The messages are sent based on a timed callback, which sends two messages per second based on a timer.

```cpp
public:
	DebugVectAdvertiser() : Node("debug_vect_advertiser") {
		publisher_ = this->create_publisher<px4_msgs::msg::DebugVect>("fmu/debug_vect/in", 10);
		auto timer_callback =
		[this]()->void {
			auto debug_vect = px4_msgs::msg::DebugVect();
			debug_vect.timestamp = std::chrono::time_point_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(std::chrono::steady_clock::now()).time_since_epoch().count();
			std::string name = "test";
			std::copy(name.begin(), name.end(), debug_vect.name.begin());
			debug_vect.x = 1.0;
			debug_vect.y = 2.0;
			debug_vect.z = 3.0;
			RCLCPP_INFO(this->get_logger(), "\033[97m Publishing debug_vect: time: %llu x: %f y: %f z: %f \033[0m",
                                debug_vect.timestamp, debug_vect.x, debug_vect.y, debug_vect.z);
			this->publisher_->publish(debug_vect);
		};
		timer_ = this->create_wall_timer(500ms, timer_callback);
	}

private:
	rclcpp::TimerBase::SharedPtr timer_;
	rclcpp::Publisher<px4_msgs::msg::DebugVect>::SharedPtr publisher_;
};
```

The instantiation of the `DebugVectAdvertiser` class as a ROS node is done on the `main` function.

```cpp
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	std::cout << "Starting debug_vect advertiser node..." << std::endl;
	setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IONBF, BUFSIZ);
	rclcpp::init(argc, argv);
	rclcpp::spin(std::make_shared<DebugVectAdvertiser>());

	rclcpp::shutdown();
	return 0;
}
```

### Offboard Control

For a complete reference example on how to use Offboard control with PX4, see: [ROS 2 Offboard control example](../ros/ros2_offboard_control.md).

## Using Flight Controller Hardware

ROS2 with PX4 running on a flight controller is almost the same as working with PX4 on the simulator.
The only difference is that you need to start both the agent _and the client_, with settings appropriate for the communication channel.

For more information see [Starting XRCE-DDS](../middleware/xrce_dds.md#starting-xrce-dds).

## Custom uORB Topics

ROS 2 needs to have the _same_ message definitions that were used to create the XRCE-DDS client module in the PX4 Firmware.
These are automatically exported to [PX4/px4_msgs](https://github.com/PX4/px4_msgs) for main and release builds, and you can just clone them into your workspace.

If working on a custom build that has other messages, you would:
- Update the [dds_topics.yaml](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/main/src/modules/microdds_client/dds_topics.yaml) to add needed topics to the XRCE-DDS client in your PX4 firmware.
- Copy the msg definitions out of the PX4 source tree into any ROS2 workspace that needs them.
  The messages must be in a folder named `px4_msgs/msg/`.
  
  :::note
  Technically the messages must be in a folder defined by the type prefix in the yaml file:
  As you can see below, this is `px4_msgs::msg::`:
  
  ```yaml
  - topic: /fmu/out/vehicle_odometry
    type: px4_msgs::msg::VehicleOdometry
  ```
  :::
  
## ros2 CLI

The [ros2 CLI](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools.html) is a useful tool for working with ROS.
You can use it, for example, to quickly check whether topics are being published, and also inspect them in detail if you have `px4_msg` in the workspace. The command also lets you launch more complex ROS systems via a launch file.
A few possibilities are demonstrated below.

### ros2 topic list

Use `ros2 topic list` to list the topics visible to ROS 2:

```sh
ros2 topic list
```

If PX4 is connected to the agent, the result will be a list of topic types:

```
/fmu/in/obstacle_distance
/fmu/in/offboard_control_mode
/fmu/in/onboard_computer_status
...
```

Note that the workspace does not need to build with `px4_msgs` for this to succeed; topic type information is part of the message payload.

### ros2 topic echo

Use `ros2 topic echo` to show the details of a particular topic.

Unlike with `ros2 topic list`, for this to work you must be in a workspace has built the `px4_msgs` and sourced `local_setup.bash` so that ROS can interpret the messages.

```sh
ros2 topic echo /fmu/out/vehicle_status
```
   
The command will echo the topic details as they update.

```
---
timestamp: 1675931593364359
armed_time: 0
takeoff_time: 0
arming_state: 1
latest_arming_reason: 0
latest_disarming_reason: 0
nav_state_timestamp: 3296000
nav_state_user_intention: 4
nav_state: 4
failure_detector_status: 0
hil_state: 0
...
---
```

### ros2 topic hz

You can get statistics about the rates of messages using `ros2 topic hz`.
For example, to get the rates for `sensor_combined`:

```
ros2 topic hz /fmu/out/sensor_combined
```

The output will look something like:

```sh
average rate: 248.187
  min: 0.000s max: 0.012s std dev: 0.00147s window: 2724
average rate: 248.006
  min: 0.000s max: 0.012s std dev: 0.00147s window: 2972
average rate: 247.330
  min: 0.000s max: 0.012s std dev: 0.00148s window: 3212
average rate: 247.497
  min: 0.000s max: 0.012s std dev: 0.00149s window: 3464
average rate: 247.458
  min: 0.000s max: 0.012s std dev: 0.00149s window: 3712
average rate: 247.485
  min: 0.000s max: 0.012s std dev: 0.00148s window: 3960
```

### ros2 launch

The `ros2 launch` command is used to start a ROS2 launch file.
For example, above we used `ros2 launch px4_ros_com sensor_combined_listener.launch.py` to start the listener example.

You don't need to have a launch file, but they are very useful if you have a complex ROS2 system that needs to start several components. 

For information about launch files see [ROS2 Tutorials > Creating launch files](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Intermediate/Launch/Creating-Launch-Files.html)



## Troubleshooting

### Missing dependencies

The standard installation should include all the tools needed by ROS2.

If any are missing, they can be added separately:
- **`colcon`** build tools should be in the development tools.
  It can be installed using:
  ```sh
  sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions
  ```
- The Eigen3 library used by the transforms library should be in the both the desktop and base packages.
  It can be installed using:
  ```sh
  sudo apt install ros-foxy-eigen3-cmake-module
  ```
