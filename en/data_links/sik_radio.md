# SiK Radio

[SiK radio](https://github.com/LorenzMeier/SiK) is a collection of firmware and tools for telemetry radios.

Information about *using* SiK Radio can be found it the *PX4 User Guide*: [Telemetry > SiK Radio](https://docs.px4.io/master/en/telemetry/sik_radio.html)

The ("developer") information below explains how to build SiK firmware from source and configure it using AT commands.

## Supported Radio Hardware

The SiK repository includes bootloaders and firmware for the following telemetry radios (2020-02-25):
- HopeRF HM-TRP
- HopeRF RF50-DEMO
- RFD900
- RFD900a
- RFD900p
- RFD900pe
- RFD900u
- RFD900ue

> **Note** The SiK repository does not currently firmware for RFD900x or RFD900ux telemetry radios**.
>  In order to update firmware on these radios (for instance, in order to support MAVLink v2.0), the following process is suggested:
>
>  1. Download the appropriate firmware from the [RFDesign website](https://files.rfdesign.com.au/firmware/).
>  1. On a Windows PC, download and install [RFD Modem Tools](https://files.rfdesign.com.au/tools/).
>  1. Use the RFD Modem Tools GUI to upload the firmware to your RFD900x or RFD900ux telemetry radio.


## Build Instructions

You will need to install the required 8051 compiler, as this is not included in the default PX4 Build toolchain.

### Mac OS

Install the toolchain:

```sh
brew install sdcc
```

Build the image for the standard SiK Radio / 3DR Radio:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/LorenzMeier/SiK.git
cd SiK/Firmware
make install
```

Upload it to the radio \(**change the serial port name**\):

```
tools/uploader.py --port /dev/tty.usbserial-CHANGETHIS dst/radio~hm_trp.ihx
```

## Configuration Instructions

The radio supports AT commands for configuration.

```sh
screen /dev/tty.usbserial-CHANGETHIS 57600 8N1
```

Then start command mode:

> **Note** DO NOT TYPE ANYTHING ONE SECOND BEFORE AND AFTER

```
+++
```

List the current settings:

```
ATI5
```

Then set the net ID, write settings and reboot radio:

```
ATS3=55
AT&W
ATZ
```

> **Note** You might have to power-cycle the radio to connect it to the 2nd radio.
