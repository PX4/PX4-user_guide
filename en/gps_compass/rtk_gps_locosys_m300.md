# Locosys M300 RTK system 

[LOCOSYS RTK-M300](https://www.locosystech.com/en/product/RTK-System/rtk-M300.html), a compact, rugged and industrial grade computer with Intel Atom® x5-E3930 processor dual core 1.3GHz (boost up to 1.8GHz), Aluminum top case with sheet metal, is designed for the harsh or need noiseless Ad-hoc network environment.

LOCOSYS RTK-M300 has the advanced RTK (Real-time kinematic) receiver supports global GPS/Glonass/Beidou/Galileo/QZSS satellites , L1+L5 Dual-frequency and multi-constellation RTK positioning solution. RTK-M300 adopt full frequency 4G-LTE communication board, Worldwide LTE, UMTS/HSPA+ and GSM/GPRS/EDGE coverage. It features 10/100/1000Mbps Ethernet data and voice connectivity. With external SIM socket, it allows user to access SIM card conveniently. RTK-M300 installs Win10 (or Linux)operating system, suitable for with LOCOSYS Firebird application software,provide user-friendly graphical operation interface, whether it is used for “Base station” management or “Rover” use.

Because of the fan-less compact design, certified (-30 ~ +70 degrees) high and low temperature test , and (MIL-STD-810) military standard vibration test, provide fast and easy installation. It is especially for the RTK Base Station with limited room space to locate the computer system, but without compromising with its space to scarify its features. Whether as a RTK Base station or RTK Rover, it is very fast and convenient to use and install. RTK-M300 keeps the flexibility to meet different demands for telemetric monitor or surveying applications.

## Wiring and Connections

The [MINI2 Receiver](http://www.femtomes.com) is connected to a UART on the flight controller (GPS port) for data.
To power the module you will need a separate 12V power supply.
The pins on the 12-pin connector are numbered as shown below.

## Configuration

This data can be acquired through serial conection by choosing the appropriate connection on a GCS such as QGround Control. The internal computer comes by default with Windows operating system installed on it meaning you can have QGC on it installed. 

1. Be sure that the GPS serial port is not occupied by any other source or applications
2. Have the Mushroom antenna connected to the provided ports on the module and place in on a stationary place. 
3. Connect QGC to the serial port to have GPS data fed to it. 

Once configured the receiver is used in the same way as any other [RTK GPS](../gps_compass/rtk_gps.md) (i.e. with respect to the Survey-in process).
