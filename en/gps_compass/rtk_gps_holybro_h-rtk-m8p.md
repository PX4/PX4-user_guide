 # Holybro H-RTK M8P GNSS

The [Holybro H-RTK M8P GNSS](http://www.holybro.com/product/h-rtk-m8p-rover-lite/) is an [RTK GNSS module](../gps_compass/rtk_gps.md) for mass market launched by Holybro. There are three models of Holybro H-RTK M8P to choose from, each with different antenna design to meet different needs. Refer to [Specification and Model Comparison section](#specification-and-model-comparison) for more details.

Using RTK allows PX4 to get its position with centimeter-level accuracy, which is much more accurate than can be provided by a normal GPS.
