# Holybro H-RTK F9P GNSS

The [Holybro H-RTK F9P GNSS](http://www.holybro.com/product/h-rtk-f9p/) is an multi-band high-precision [RTK GNSS System](../gps_compass/rtk_gps.md) series launched by Holybro. This family is similar to the [H-RTK F9P](../gps_compass/rtk_gps_holybro_h-rtk-m8p.md) family but uses multi-band RTK with faster convergence times and reliable performance, concurrent reception of GPS, GLONASS, Galileo and BeiDou, and faster update rate for highly dynamic and high volume applications with centimeter-accuracy. It uses a UBLOX F9P module, a IST8310 compass, and a tri-colored LED indicator. It also has a integrated safety switch for a simple and convenient operation.

There are three models of Holybro H-RTK F9P to choose from, each with different antenna design to meet different needs.
Refer to [Specification and Model Comparison section](#specification-and-model-comparison) for more details.

Using RTK allows PX4 to get its position with centimeter-level accuracy, which is much more accurate than can be provided by a normal GPS.
