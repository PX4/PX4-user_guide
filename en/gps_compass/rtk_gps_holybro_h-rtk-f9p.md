# Holybro H-RTK F9P GNSS

The [Holybro H-RTK F9P GNSS](http://www.holybro.com/product/h-rtk-f9p/) is an multi-band high-precision [RTK GNSS System](../gps_compass/rtk_gps.md) series launched by Holybro.
This family is similar to the [H-RTK M8P](../gps_compass/rtk_gps_holybro_h-rtk-m8p.md) series, but uses multi-band RTK with faster convergence times and reliable performance, concurrent reception of GPS, GLONASS, Galileo and BeiDou, and faster update rate for highly dynamic and high volume applications with centimeter-accuracy.
It uses a u-blox F9P module, a IST8310 compass, and a tri-colored LED indicator.
It also has an integrated safety switch for a simple and convenient operation.

There are three models of Holybro H-RTK F9P to choose from, each with different antenna design to meet different needs.
Refer to [Specification and Model Comparison section](#specification-and-model-comparison) for more details.

Using RTK allows PX4 to get its position with centimeter-level accuracy, which is much more accurate than can be provided by a normal GPS.

## Configuration

RTK setup and use on PX4 via _QGroundControl_ is largely plug and play \(see [RTK GPS](../advanced_features/rtk-gps.md) for more information\).

## Wiring and Connections

H-RTK Helical models come with both GH 10-pin & 6-pin cables that are compatible with the GPS1 & GPS2 ports on flight controllers that use the Pixhawk Connector Standard, such as [Pixhawk 4](../flight_controller/pixhawk4.md) and [Pixhawk 5x](../flight_controller/pixhawk5x.md).

The H-RTK Rover Lite comes in two version.
The standard version comes with 10 pin connector for the `GPS1` port.
The "2nd GPS" version comes with 6 pin connector for the `GPS2` port.
This is used as a secondary GPS for [Dual GPS Systems](../gps_compass/README.md#dual_gps).

:::note
The cables/connectors may need to be modified in order to connect to other flight controller boards (see [Pin Map](#pin-map) below).
