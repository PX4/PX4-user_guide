# Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)

PX4 supports Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, Beidou, QZSS and SBAS, etc. using receivers that communicate via the u-blox, MTK Ashtech or Emlid protocols, or via UAVCAN.
A GNSS system is needed for missions, and some other automatic and manual/assisted modes.

Most GNSS modules also contain a [compass/magnetometer](../gps_compass/magnetometer.md) part (see link for calibration/setup information).
Because of this the GNSS module should be mounted as far away from the motor/ESC power supply lines as possible - typically on a pedestal or wing (for fixed-wing).
Many also include a [safety switch](../getting_started/px4_basic_concepts.md#safety-switch), [buzzer](../getting_started/px4_basic_concepts.md#buzzer) and [UI LED](../getting_started/led_meanings.html#ui-led).

::: info
PX4 also supports [Real Time Kinematic (RTK)](../gps_compass/rtk_gps.md) and **Post-Processing Kinematic (PPK)** GNSS Receivers, which extend GNSS systems to centimetre-level precision.

## Supported GNSS

PX4 should work with any unit that communicates via the u-blox, MTK Ashtech or Emlid protocols, or via UAVCAN.

This table contains non-RTK GNSS units (most of which also have a compass).
These have been tested by the PX4 dev team, or which are popular within the PX4 community.

Notes:

- &check; or a specific part number indicate that a features is supported, while &cross; or empty show that the feature is not supported.
  "?" indicates "unknown".
- Where possible and relevant the part name is used (i.e. &check; in the GPS column indicates that a GPS module is present but the part is not known).
- The list may omit some discontinued hardware that is still supported.
  The original _Here_ has already been removed.
  Check earlier versions if a discontinued module is not mentioned here.

## Mounting the GNSS/Compass

[Mounting the Compass](../assembly/mount_gps_compass.md) explains how to mount a GNSS module that has a compass (it is the compass part that is affected by electromagnetic radiation).

## Hardware Setup

Instructions for connecting the GPS (and compass, if present) are usually provided by the manufacturer (at least for more common [Autopilot Hardware](../flight_controller/index.md)).

[Pixhawk Series](../flight_controller/pixhawk_series.md) controllers typically have a clearly labeled port for connecting the GPS, and the compass is connected to either the I2C or SPI port/bus (depending on the device).

The [ARK GPS](../dronecan/ark_gps.md), [ARK RTK GPS](../dronecan/ark_rtk_gps.md), [Zubax GNSS 2](https://zubax.com/products/gnss_2), [CUAV C-RTK2](../gps_compass/rtk_gps_cuav_c-rtk.md), [CubePilot Here3 CAN GNSS GPS (M8N)](https://www.cubepilot.org/#/here/here3), and [Avionics Anonymous GNSS/Mag](https://www.tindie.com/products/avionicsanonymous/uavcan-gps-magnetometer/) can also be connected via [DroneCAN](../dronecan/index.md).

:::warning
Pay attention to pinout when connecting the GPS module.
While these are all software-compatible, there are several different pin orderings.
:::

## GNSS Configuration

The "standard" GPS configuration is provided below.
Additional device-specific configuration may be provided in PX4 or manufacturer device documentation (e.g. [Trimble MB-Two > Configuration](../gps_compass/rtk_gps_trimble_mb_two.md#configuration)).

:::warning
The GPS protocol expected by PX4 defaults to u-blox (by default other GPS types like Trimble, Emlid, MTK, will not be detected)
The protocol can be configured with [GPS_x_PROTOCOL](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#GPS_1_PROTOCOL).
:::

### Configuring the Primary GPS

GPS configuration on Pixhawk is handled transparently for the user - simply connect the GPS module to the port labeled **GPS** and everything should work.

::: info
The default [Serial Port Configuration](../peripherals/serial_configuration.md#default_port_mapping) works for most devices.
If you are using the _Trimble MB-Two_ you will need to modify the configuration to explicitly set the rate to 115200 baud.

### Configuring a Secondary GPS (Dual GPS System)

To use a secondary GPS, attach it to any free port, and then perform a [Serial Port Configuration](../peripherals/serial_configuration.md) to assign [GPS_2_CONFIG](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#GPS_2_CONFIG) to the selected port.

The following steps show how to configure a secondary GPS on the `TELEM 2` port in _QGroundControl_:

1. [Find and set](../advanced_config/parameters.md) the parameter [GPS_2_CONFIG](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#GPS_2_CONFIG) to **TELEM 2**.
   - Open _QGroundControl_ and navigate to the **Vehicle Setup > Parameters** section.
   - Select the **GPS** tab (1), then open the [GPS_2_CONFIG](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#GPS_2_CONFIG) parameter (2) and select _TELEM 2_ from the dropdown list (3).
     ![QGC Serial Example](../../assets/peripherals/qgc_serial_config_example.png)
1. Reboot the vehicle in order to make the other parameters visible.
1. Select the **Serial** tab, and open the [SER_TEL2_BAUD](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#SER_TEL2_BAUD) parameter (`TELEM 2` port baud rate): set it to _Auto_.
   ![QGC Serial Baudrate Example](../../assets/peripherals/qgc_serial_baudrate_example.png)

After setting up the second GPS port:

1. Configure the ECL/EKF2 estimator to blend data from both GPS systems.
   For detailed instructions see: [Using the ECL EKF > Dual Receivers](../advanced_config/tuning_the_ecl_ekf.md#dual-receivers).

### Configuring GPS as Yaw/Heading Source

GPS can be used as a source for yaw fusion when using modules where _yaw output is supported by the device_.
This is documented in [RTK GPS > Configuring GPS as Yaw/Heading Source](../gps_compass/rtk_gps.md#configuring-gps-as-yaw-heading-source).

## Compass Configuration

Compass calibration for an included compass part is covered in: [Compass Configuration](../config/compass.md).
