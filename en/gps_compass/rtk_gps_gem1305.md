# DATAGNSS GEM1305 RTK Receiver with antenna

GEM1305 is a RTK receiver with antenna designed and manufactured by [DATAGNSS](https://www.datagnss.com/).

GEM1305 is based on the new generation CYNOSURE IV dual-core GNSS SoC.
It supports RTK functionality with a maximum data update rate of 10Hz.

## Pinout

The board is connected to the autopilot via UART interface.

![GEM1305 connector](../../assets/hardware/gps/datagnss_gem1305/GEM1305-connector.png)

The 1.25mm pitch 6P connector (from left: PIN1 to PIN6):

- 1: GND
- 2: NC
- 3: PPS
- 4: Rx
- 5: Tx
- 6: 5V

The board does not include a compass and so does not require connections for a compass part.

## Hardware Setup

RTK requires a base RTK module attached to the ground station, and a rover RTK module on the vehicle.
The data from the base needs to be transmitted to the drone via telemetry radio and inputed into the RTK receiver on the rover.

The setup/connections for base and rover modules are shown below.

### Base Setup (GCS)

The base station connections are shown in the diagram below, along with the connection to a telemetry radio.

Note that for the base we recommend the [NANO RTK Receiver](https://www.datagnss.com/collections/gnss-for-drone/products/multi-band-rtk-receiver-package) because it is easier to setup.

See to [How to setup Base station](https://wiki.datagnss.com/index.php/GEM1305-autopilot) for more details.

### Rover Setup (PX4)

The rover setup showing connections to a GPS port and the (required) connection to a telemetry radio are shown in the diagram below.

![Rover module and pixhawk big picture connections](../../assets/hardware/gps/datagnss_gem1305/rover_gnss_setup.png)

The diagram below shows how you might connect to the `GPS` port on the Pixawk 2.4.8 flight controller.
The same connection approach might be used on a more recent flight controller.

::: warning
Pixawk 2.4.8 is a clone of a very old Pixhawk series design.
Even though it is inexpensive it is not recommended: the board has such little memory that it can be difficult to find space for all the software components you need.
It also uses non-Pixhawk standard connectors which are far less reliable, and works with many fewer components out of the box.

GPS and RTK configuration on PX4 via _QGroundControl_ is plug and play (see [RTK GPS](../gps_compass/rtk_gps.md) for more information).
