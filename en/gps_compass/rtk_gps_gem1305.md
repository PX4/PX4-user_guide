The 1.25mm pitch 6P connector (from Left PIN1 to PIN6):

- 1: GND
- 2: NC
- 3: PPS
- 4: Rx
- 5: Tx
- 6: 5V

Please note that the board only includes RTK and doesn't include compass.

## Setup

RTK setup on PX4 via _QGroundControl_ is plug and play (see [RTK GPS](../gps_compass/rtk_gps.md) for more information).

## Wiring and Connections

RTK technology can greatly improve the accuracy of positioning.

RTK technology requires a base and a rover, with the base placed on the ground, which is referred to as the rover on the drone. The data from the base needs to be transmitted to the drone via telemetry radio and inputted into the RTK receiver on the rover.

The 6-pins connector provides the interface for RTK, the 2.54mm Pin Header also support for RTK data input and output.
You could connect the 6-pins connector or Pin Header to the flight controller's GPS port.
