# Community Supported Developer Tools

This section contains information about _community-supported_ development setups, IDEs, simulators, and other tools.

:::warning
These setups are not maintained, tested, or supported, by the core development team.
For information about supported toolchains see: [Toolchain Installation](../dev_setup/dev_env.md).
:::

The tools have variable levels of support from their communities (some are well supported and others are not).
Questions about these tools should be raised on the [discussion forums](../contribute/support.md#forums-and-chat)
