## Assembly

Estimate time to assemble is 3.75 hours (180 minutes for frame, 45 minutes for autopilot installation/configuration)

**Step 1:** We are going to start by assembling the landing gear to the vertical pole.
Unscrew the landing gear screws and insert the vertical pole, see figures 1 and 2.

![Landing Figure 1](../../assets/airframes/multicopter/x500_holybro_pixhawk4/x500_step_1_fig1.jpg)

(Figure 1)

![Landing Figure 2](../../assets/airframes/multicopter/x500_holybro_pixhawk4/x500_step_1_fig2.jpg)

(Figure 2)

**Step 2:** We proceed to put the 4 arms through the 4 motor bases shown in figure 3. Make sure the rods protrude the base slightly and are consistent throughout all 4 arms, and be sure to have the motor wires facing outward.

![Motor](../../assets/airframes/multicopter/x500_holybro_pixhawk4/x500_step_2_fig3.png)

(Figure 3)

**Step 3:** Insert 4 nylon screws and nylon standoffs and attach the power module PM07 to the bottom plate using 4 nylon nuts as shown in Figures 4.

![power_module](../../assets/airframes/multicopter/x500_holybro_pixhawk4/power_module.jpg)

(Figure 4)

**Step 4:** Feed the 4 motor ESCs through each of the arms and connect the 3-wires end to the motors shown in Figure 5.

<img src="../../assets/airframes/multicopter/x500_holybro_pixhawk4/x500_fig17.jpg" width="250">

(Figure 5)

**Step 5:** Connect the ESCs power wires onto the power module PM07, black->black and red->red, ESC PWM signal wires goes to "FMU-PWM-Out". Make sure you connect the motor ESC PWM wires in the correct order. Refer to Figure 7 for airframe motor number and connect to the corrsponding number on the PM07 board.

The color on top of the motor indicate the spin direction (figure 7-1), black tip is clockwise, and white tip is counter-clockwise. Make sure the follow the px4 quadrotor x airframe reference for direction.

(Figure 7)                                                  (Figure 7-1)

**Step 6:** Connect the 10 pin cables to FMU-PWM-in, the 6 pin cables to the PWR1 on the PM07 power module.

(Figure 8)

**Step 7** If you want to mount the GPS on the top plate, you can now secure the GPS mount onto the top plate using 4 screws and nuts.

<img src="../../assets/airframes/multicopter/x500_holybro_pixhawk4/gpsmount.jpg" width="400">

(Figure 9)

**Step 8:** Feed the PM07 cables through the top plate. Connect the top and bottom plate by using 4 U-shaped nylon straps, screws, and nuts on each side, ensure that the motor ESC cables are inside the U-shape nylon straps like Figure 10, keep the nut loose.

**Step 9:**
Push the arm tubes a bit into the frame and make sure the amount of protrusion (red square from Figure 11) are consistent on all 4 arms. Ensure all the motors are pointed directly upward, then tighten all the nuts and screws.

![Arms 3](../../assets/airframes/multicopter/x500_holybro_pixhawk4/x500_fig16.jpg)

**Step 10:**
Put the hanger gaskets into the 4 hangers (Figure 11) and mount them onto the bottom plate using 8 hex screws. The screw holes are noted by the white arrow in Figure 12. It is recommended to tilt the drone sideway to make the installation easier.

(Figure 11)

![Battery Mount 4](../../assets/airframes/multicopter/x500_holybro_pixhawk4/x500_fig10.jpg)

(Figure 12)

**Step 11:**
Insert the slide bars (Figure 13) to the hanger rings. Assemble the battery mount and platform board and mount them onto the slide bars as shown in Figure 14.

(Figure 14)

**Step 12**
Mount the landing gear onto the bottom plate. It is recommended to tilt the drone sideway to make this installation process easier.

![Landing Gear](../../assets/airframes/multicopter/x500_holybro_pixhawk4/x500_fig5.jpg)

(Figure 15)

**Step 13**
Use the tape and stick the GPS to the top of the GPS mast and mount the GPS mast, make sure the arrow on the gps (Figure 16) is pointing forward.

<img src="../../assets/airframes/multicopter/x500_holybro_pixhawk4/gps2.jpg" width="400">


(Figure 16)

**Step 14:** Mount the telemetry radio onto the top plate. Plug the telemetry cable into TELEM1 port and GPS module to GPS MODULE port on the flight controller. Plug the cable from PM07 FMU-PWM-in to FMU-PWM-out and PWR1 to POWER1 on the flight controller shown in Figure 17.

## Install/Configure PX4

*QGroundControl* is used to install the PX4 autopilot and configure/tune it for the X500 frame.
[Download and install](http://qgroundcontrol.com/downloads/)
*QGroundControl* for your platform.

:::tip
Full instructions for installing and configuring PX4 can be found in [Basic Configuration](../config/README.md).
:::

First update the firmware and airframe:
* [Firmware](../config/firmware.md)
* [Airframe](../config/airframe.md)

:::note
You will need to select the *Holybro S500* airframe (**Quadrotor x > Holybro S500**).
:::

![QGroundControl - Select HolyBro S500 airframe](../../assets/airframes/multicopter/x500_holybro_pixhawk4/S500_airframe_use_for_X500.jpg)

Then perform the mandatory setup/calibration:
* [Sensor Orientation](../config/flight_controller_orientation.md)
* [Compass](../config/compass.md)
* [Accelerometer](../config/accelerometer.md)
* [Level Horizon Calibration](../config/level_horizon_calibration.md)
* [Radio Setup](../config/radio.md)
* [Flight Modes](../config/flight_mode.md)

Ideally you should also do:
* [ESC Calibration](../advanced_config/esc_calibration.md)
* [Battery](../config/battery.md)
* [Safety](../config/safety.md)

## Tuning

Airframe selection sets *default* autopilot parameters for the frame.
These are good enough to fly with, but it is a good idea to tune the parameters for a specific frame build.

For general information on tuning see: [Multicopter PID Tuning Guide](../config_mc/pid_tuning_guide_multicopter.md).
