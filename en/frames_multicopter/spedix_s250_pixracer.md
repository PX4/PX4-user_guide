## Mounting and Wiring

Connect GPS and the Wifi module as shown inÂ the [Pixracer instructions](../flight_controller/pixracer.md). 
Connect the four motors in the layout and order as shown below, so the MAIN1 connector should
connect to motor 1, and so on.

## Airframe Configuration

Select the QAV250 configuration as shown below. This will not only put
PX4 into quadrotor mode, but also load decent default tuning gains.
