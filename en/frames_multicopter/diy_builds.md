# DIY Builds (Multicopter)

Do-it-yourself (DIY) builds assemble a vehicle from parts that are sourced separately.

:::note
[Kits](../frames_multicopter/kits.md) provide a gentler introduction to building a drone, and should be considered if you are just starting out!

Note that some parts used in the builds linked below may no longer be available.
Consider it part of the challenge to find adequate replacement parts!
:::

At the "easy" end of the scale are builds that take an existing RC vehicle and graft on a flight controller.
At the "hard" end of the scale are unique vehicle, such as the [Omnicopter (KakuteH7)](../frames_multicopter/omnicopter.md), where the vehicle is a new design and some parts may be fabricated using 3D printers.
Somewhere in the middle are builds that use separate but readily available components: frame, motors, ESC, propellers, flight controller, and so on.
