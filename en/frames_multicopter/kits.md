# Multicopter Kits

Kits that contains all the parts needed for building a PX4-compatible vehicle (with the possible exception of batteries and RC controllers).

:::note
Kits provide a gentler introduction to building drones than starting from individual components.
They allow you to use parts that are known to work, and to fly a vehicle that is appropriately tuned.
