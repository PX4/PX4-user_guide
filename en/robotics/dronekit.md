# DroneKit

DroneKit is no longer recommended.

You should instead use [MAVSDK](https://mavsdk.mavlink.io/) with PX4, as this is far better in almost every way: features, speed, programming language support, maintenance, etc.

Documentation on using DroneKit with PX4 can be found here: [PX4 v1.12 > DroneKit](https://docs.px4.io/v1.12/en/robotics/dronekit.html).
