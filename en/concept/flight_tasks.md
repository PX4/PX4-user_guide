# Flight Tasks

*Flight Tasks* are used within [Flight Modes](../concept/flight_modes.md) to provide specific movement behaviours: e.g. follow me, or flight smoothing.

At time of writing the best description of how flight modes work (in PX4 v1.9) is provided in the following video: **PX4 Flight Task Architecture Overview** - Dennis Mannhart, Matthias Grob (*PX4 Developer Summit 2019*).

## Create and Test new flight task
Description for creating and testing your own flight task.
In this tutorial, the name of the flight task supposes "Test".

### Steps Overview 
#### Create flight task
- Create a directory named with new flight task in `PX4-Autopilot/src/lib/flight_tasks/tasks`
- Create files for new flight task
  - CMakeLists.txt
  - FlightTaskTest.hpp
  - FlightTaskTest.cpp
- Edit CMakeLists.txt
- Edit .hpp and .cpp files
- Edit mc_pos_control_params.c in `PX4-Autopilot/src/modules/mc_pos_control`
- Edit mc_pos_control_main.cpp in `PX4-Autopilot/src/modules/mc_pos_control`
- Edit CMakeLists.txt in `PX4-Autopilot/src/lib/flight_tasks`

#### Test flight task
- Build firmware and launch SITL on gazebo
- Launch QGC
  - Enable virtual joystick, if you have not already configured.
- Launch mavros ( connect SITL and QGC via mavros )
- Set parameter `MPC_POS_MODE` for new flight task
- Takeoff the vehicle
- Switch into Position flight mode. ( new flight task should be applied. )

### Details
#### Create flight task

- Edit mc_pos_control_params.c in `PX4-Autopilot/src/modules/mc_pos_control`  
  Add value for Manual-Position control sub-mode.  
  Add a line like `@value 2 Test`, since value 2 is not used yet.

       *   without smoothing. Useful for velocity control tuning.
       * 1 Smooth position control with maximum acceleration and jerk limits based on slew-rates.
       * 3 Smooth position control with maximum acceleration and jerk limits based on
       *   jerk optimized trajectory generator (different algorithm than 1).

- Edit mc_pos_control_main.cpp in `PX4-Autopilot/src/modules/mc_pos_control`  
  Add switch case in the switch statement for param `MPC_POS_MODE`  
  ```c++
  case 2:
    error = _flight_tasks.switchTask(FlightTaskIndex::Test);
    break;

  </details>
  
- Edit CMakeLists.txt in `PX4-Autopilot/src/lib/flight_tasks`  
  Add the name of the new flight task's directory to core flight task list.  
  In this case, the name is `Test`  
  <details>

  </details>

#### Test flight task  
- Build firmware and launch SITL on gazebo    
  cd into PX4-Autopilot directory. Then, build firmware and launch gazebo with command below.  
  ```
  make px4_sitl gazebo
  ```
  
- Launch QGC  
  - Launch QGC.  
    If you do not have it, download from [here](https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/master/en/getting_started/download_and_install.html).  
  - Enable virtual joystick, if you have not already configured.  
    - Open `Application Settings` window. ( Click QGC icon on the top-left of the window. )  
    - Open `General` tab.  
    - Check `Virtual joystick` and `Auto-Center Throttle` in `Fly View`.  

- Launch mavros ( connect SITL and QGC via mavros )  
  Launch mavros with command below.  
  â€»you should replace `x.x.x.x` of gcs_url to your computer's IP address which is running QGC.  
  ```
  roslaunch mavros px4.launch fcu_url:="udp://:14540@localhost:14557" gcs_url:="udp://@x.x.x.x"
  ```
  <details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
  
    - Check connection to SITL  
      Type command below on a terminal.  
      ```
      rostopic echo /mavros/state
      ```
      If you can see outputs like below, SITL has connected to mavros properly.  
      ```
      ---
      header: 
        seq: 17206
        stamp: 
          secs: 1608138069
          nsecs: 991425650
        frame_id: ''
      connected: True
      armed: False
      guided: False
      manual_input: True
      mode: "MANUAL"
      system_status: 3
      ```
    - Make sure that QGC is connected to SITL  
      you can see vehicle's information on QGC, if SITL is connected properly.  

  </details>
  
- Set parameter `MPC_POS_MODE` for new flight task  
  Set parameter `MPC_POS_MODE` to `2`(as we decided in previous step) by mavparam.  
  ```
  rosrun mavros mavparam set MPC_POS_MODE 2
  ```
  You can check if the parameter has set properly with command below.  
  ```
  rosrun mavros mavparam get MPC_POS_MODE
  ```
  Or you can set this parameter from QGC. (But the name of new flight task is not been reflected on QGC. You should select the third option from the top. )  
  
- Takeoff the vehicle  
  Make your vehicle take off. ( You can do that from QGC with Takeoff button. )  
  Your vehicle should keep being in the air to properly complete activate function of new flight task in the next step. ( e.g. Hold Mode )  
  
- Switch into Position flight mode. ( new flight task should be applied. )  
  Switch into Position flight mode by selecting `Position` on QGC.    
  Finally, your vehicle should behave going up changing its yaw.
