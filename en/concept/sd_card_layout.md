# PX4 SD Card Layout

The PX4 SD Card is used for storing configuration files, flight logs, mission information etc. 

> **Tip** The SD card should be FAT32 formatted for use with PX4 (this is the default for SD cards).
  We recommend that you reformat cards that are using a different file system.

The directory structure/layout is shown below.

Directory/File(s) | Description
--- | ---
/etc/ | Extra config (+ mixers). See [System Startup > Replacing the System Startup](../concept/system_startup.md#replacing-the-system-startup).
/etc/mixers/ | [Mixers](../concept/mixing.md)
/log/ | Full [flight logs](../log/logging.md)
/mission_log/ | Reduced flight logs
/fw/ | [UAVCAN](../uavcan/README.md) firmware

/params | Parameters (if not in FRAM/FLASH)
