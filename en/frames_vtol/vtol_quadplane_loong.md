## Hardware Integration

In this documentation the integration of a Auterion Skynode is described. The installation of a Pixhawk can be done similarly.

### Preparations

### Avionics Unit

#### Prepare 3D-Printed Parts

Insert 10x M3 threaded inserts into the baseplate as shown in the picture:

Insert 2x M3 threaded inserts into the stack fixture as shown in the picture below:

Insert 2x M4 threaded inserts into the fan mount and radio mount as shown in the picture below. If you would like to add a 40mm 5V fan to the fan mount, insert 4x M3 inserts.

#### 40A Power Module

Remove the case from the 40A PM that comes with the Skynode evaluation kit. Screw the the PM with 2x M2x6mm to the bottom of the baseplate. Create a cable to extend the connector
