# Tailsitter VTOL

A **Tailsitter VTOL** takes off and lands on its tail, but flips into the fixed-wing orientation for normal flight.
The tailsitter rotors are permanently fixed in position for forward flight.

Tailsitters are typically mechanically less complex than [other types of VTOL](../frames_vtol/README.md), and hence may be less expensive to build and maintain.
However they are aerodynamically more complex, and can be harder to tune and fly for hover and transition, particularly in windy conditions.

  VTOL with optional elevons. Uses rotors to transition between modes (along with elevons if present).

Duo Tailsitters are generally more efficient in cruise flight (4 smaller propellers are less efficient than 2 larger ones) and physically more compact.
However as they are aerodynamically much more complex in hover mode, they are much harder to tune for both hover and transition.
Quad tailsitters are easier to fly in hover mode, and more stable in windy conditions.
Both are supported using the same aiframe type in PX4.

## Setup/Flying

VTOL setup and flying are covered in the [VTOL](../frames_vtol/README.md) parent topic.

:::note
The instructions are essentially the same for all VTOL.
The main frame-specific differences are the motor wiring, and some aspects of tuning the configuration.

## Build Logs

Step-by-step guides of how to set up PX4 on tailsitter frames are listed below:

- [TBS Caipiroshka Tailsitter Build (Pixracer)](../frames_vtol/vtol_tailsitter_caipiroshka_pixracer.md)

:::tip
We recommend that you also review build logs for other PX4 VTOL, and Copter vehicles (most of the setup is the same).
