# E-flite Convergence Tiltrotor VTOL (Pixfalcon)

The [E-Flite Convergence](https://youtu.be/HNedXQ_jhYo) can easily be converted to a fully autonomous VTOL with PX4.
There is not much space but it's enough for a [Pixfalcon](../flight_controller/pixfalcon.md) flight controller with GPS and telemetry.

:::note
The original [Horizon Hobby *E-Flite Convergence*](https://www.modelflight.com.au/e-flite-convergence-vtol-bnf-basic.html) frame and [Pixfalcon](../flight_controller/pixfalcon.md) have been discontinued.
Alternatives are provided in the [Purchase](#purchase) section.

Flight controller options ():
- [Pixhawk 4 Mini](../flight_controller/pixhawk4_mini.md)
- [Holybro Pixhawk Mini](../flight_controller/pixhawk_mini.md).
- Any other compatible flight controller with small enough form-factor.

## Hardware Setup

The vehicle needs 7 PWM signals, which must be connected to the flight controller outputs as specified in [Airframe Reference > VTOL Tiltrotor > E-flite Convergence](../airframes/airframe_reference.md#vtol_vtol_tiltrotor_e-flite_convergence).
This mapping is reproduced below. 

Port | Connection
--- | --- 
MAIN 1 | Motor right
MAIN 2 | Motor left
MAIN 3 | Motor back
MAIN 4 | empty
MAIN 5 | Tilt servo right
MAIN 6 | Tilt servo left
MAIN 7 | Elevon right
MAIN 8 | Elevon left

Note that left and right in the reference are defined from the perspective of a human pilot inside a real plane (or looking from above, as shown below):

### Flight Controller

The flight controller can be mounted at the same place the original autopilot was.

### Telemetry Radio

The telemetry module fits into the bay meant to hold FPV transmission gear.

### GPS

For the GPS we cut out a section of foam inside the "cockpit".
That way the GPS can be put inside the body and is nicely stowed away without compromising the vehicle appearance.

## PX4 Configuration

Follow the [Standard Configuration](config/README.md) in *QGroundControl* (radio, sensors, flight modes, etc.).

The particular settings that are relevant to this vehicle are:
- [Airframe](config/airframe.md) 
  - Select the airframe configuration **E-flite Convergence** under **VTOL Tiltrotor** and restart *QGroundControl*.
    ![QGroundControl Vehicle Setting - Airframe selection E-Flight](../../assets/airframes/vtol/eflite_convergence_pixfalcon/qgc_setup_airframe.jpg)
- [Flight Modes/Switches](../config/flight_mode.md)
  - As this is a VTOL vehicle, you must [assign an RC controller switch](../config/flight_mode.md#what-flight-modes-and-switches-should-i-set) for transitioning between multicopter and fixed-wing modes.

:::note
By default permanent stabilization is enabled.
To fly "fully manual" in fixed-wing mode, set [VT_FW_PERM_STAB](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#VT_FW_PERM_STAB) to `0`.
