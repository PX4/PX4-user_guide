## PX4-Autopilot v1.14 Release Notes

## Major Changes

### Actuator Configuration UI

The [Actuator Configuration UI](../config/actuators.md) replaces mixer files for defining vehicle geometry, mapping motors and other functions to specific flight control outputs, and testing actuator behaviour.

:::warning
This feature was an experimental option for v1.13, but is now enabled by default.
Vehicles that used custom mixer files in v1.13 will need to replace them when upgrading to PX4 v1.14.
Other vehicles may need to configure output mappings when updating.
:::

The mixer file approach effectively hard-coded the geometry, and outputs that you had to use for each motor and actuator on a frame.
Using [dynamic control allocation](../concept/control_allocation.md) is much more flexible because the configuration can depend on the airframe that you select.
For example, selecting a generic airframe will allow you to specify both the geometry and output mapping, while selecting a particular ready-to-fly vehicle only allows you to test the output mappings (because everything else is hard coded/wired).
Selecting a frame like an S-500 is somewhere in between: the geometry is fixed but you can map the flight controller outputs to whatever motors you like.

:::note
To use the new actuator configuration UI, you must have a recent release version of QGroundControl (version 4.2.0 or later).

### Gazebo Simulator Changes

Our [simulator](../simulation/README.md) naming convention has changed, because the [Open Source Robotics Foundation (OSRF)](https://www.openrobotics.org/) is in process of retiring the original Gazebo architecture:

- The previous Gazebo architecture is now referred to as [Gazebo Classic](../sim_gazebo_classic/README.md#running-the-simulation), and the new architecture has taken the name [Gazebo](../sim_gazebo_gz/README.md) (the current release is "Gazebo Garden").
- Gazebo Classic `make` targets are now prefixed with `gazebo-classic_` (e.g. `make px4_sitl gazebo-classic_cloudship`).
- Gazebo targets are prefixed with `gz_` (e.g. `make px4_sitl gz_x500`).

You can still use [Gazebo Classic](../sim_gazebo_classic/README.md#running-the-simulation) simulation in Ubuntu 20.04 or older.
From Ubuntu 22.04 only Gazebo is supported and can be installed.

Gazebo supports a number of vehicles and can also be used for multivehicle simulation.
However the set of vehicles is still less diverse than available in Gazebo classic, so we'd very much welcome the contribution of more simulation targets.

### ROS2 & XRCE-DDS Bridge

[ROS2 support with micro XRCE-DDS bridge](../ros/ros2_comm.md) was added, replacing the [MicroRTPS bridge](https://docs.px4.io/v1.13/en/middleware/micrortps.html) middleware used in PX4v1.13 with [uXRCE-DDS](../middleware/uxrce_dds.md).

:::note
XRCE-DDS was an experimental opt-in feature in v1.13.
:::

The new architecture provides a more seemless integration with ROS 2, using the same message definition for both uORB and ROS2 topics, which are maintained in a single shared repository.
It also provides a building block for microROS, which will allow ROS 2 nodes to be defined directly within PX4.

ROS 2 users from PX4 v1.13 will need to use the new XRCE_DDS agent, and build their applications using the new message definitions.
However they should generally not have to update their actual ROS 2 code.
