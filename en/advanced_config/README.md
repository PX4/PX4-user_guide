# Advanced Configuration

This section contains advanced configuration topics, covering vehicle-specific tuning, and less-common sensors and peripherals.
 
:::tip
The topics are useful if you are creating a new airframe type or significantly modifying a supported frame.
Generally if you're using a [supported airframe](../airframes/airframe_reference.md#copter) (e.g. from [QGroundControl > Airframe](../config/airframe.md)) the default tuning and configuration should be acceptable. 
:::

For the standard configuration appropriate to every vehicle see: [Basic Configuration](../config/README.md).
