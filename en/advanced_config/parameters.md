# Finding/Updating Parameters

PX4 behaviour can be configured/tuned using [parameters](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md) (e.g. [Multicopter PID gains](../config_mc/pid_tuning_guide_multicopter.md), calibration information, etc.).

The *QGroundControl Parameters* screen allows you to find and modify **any** of the parameters associated with the vehicle.
The screen is accessed by clicking the top menu *Gear* icon and then *Parameters* in the sidebar.

> **Note** Most of the more commonly used parameters are more conveniently set using the dedicated setup screens described in the [Basic Configuration](../config/README.md) section.
  The *Parameters* screen is needed when modifying less commonly modified parameters - for example while tuning a new vehicle.

> **Warning** While some parameters can be changed in flight, this is not recommended (except where explicitly stated in the guide).


## Finding a Parameter {#finding}

You can search for a parameter by entering a term in the *Search* field.
This will show you a list of all parameter names and descriptions that contain the entered substring (press **Clear** to reset the search).

![Parameters Search](../../assets/qgc/setup/parameters/parameters_search.jpg)

You can also browse the parameters by group by clicking on the buttons to the left (in the image below the *Battery Calibration* group is selected).

> **Tip** If you can't find an expected parameter, see the [next section](#missing).


## Missing Parameters {#missing}

Parameters are usually not visible because either they are conditional on other parameters, or they are not present in the firmware (see below).

### Conditional Parameters

A parameter may not be displayed if it is conditional on another parameter that is not enabled.

You can usually find out what parameters are conditional by searching the [full parameter reference](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md) and other documentation.
In particular [serial port configuration parameters](../peripherals/serial_configuration.md) depend on what service is assigned to a serial port.


### Parameter Not In Firmware

A parameter may not be present in the firmware because you're using a different version of PX4 or because you're using a build in which the associated module is not included.

New parameters are added in each PX4 version, and existing parameters are sometimes removed or renamed.
You can check whether a parameter *should* be present by reviewing the [full parameter reference](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md) for the version you're targeting.
You can also search for the parameter in the source tree and in the release notes.

The other reason that a parameter might not be in firmware is if its associated module has not been included.
This is a problem (in particular) for *FMUv2 firmware*, which omits many modules so that PX4 can fit into the 1MB of available flash.
There are two options to solve this problem:
- Check if you can update your board to run FMUv3 firmware, which includes all modules: [Firmware > FMUv2 Bootloader Update](../config/firmware.md#bootloader)
- If your board can only run FMUv2 firmware you will need to [rebuild PX4](https://dev.px4.io/master/en/setup/building_px4.html) with the missing modules enabled.
  You can see these commented out in [boards/px4/fmu-v2/default.cmake](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/boards/px4/fmu-v2/default.cmake):
  ```
  	DRIVERS
		adc
		#barometer # all available barometer drivers
		barometer/ms5611
		#batt_smbus
		#camera_capture
  ```
  > **Note** You may also need to disable other modules in order to fit the rebuilt firmware into 1MB flash.
    Finding modules to remove requires some trial/error and depends on what use cases you need the vehicle to meet.


## Changing a Parameter {#changing}

To change the value of a parameter click on the parameter row in a group or search list.
This will open a side dialog in which you can update the value (this dialog also provides additional detailed information about the parameter - including whether a reboot is required for the change to take effect).

![Changing a parameter value](../../assets/qgc/setup/parameters/parameters_changing.png)

> **Note** When you click **Save** the parameter is automatically and silently uploaded to the connected vehicle.
  Depending on the parameter, you may then need to reboot the flight controller for the change to take effect.


## Tools

You can select additional options from the **Tools** menu on the top right hand side of the screen.

![Tools menu](../../assets/qgc/setup/parameters/parameters_tools_menu.png)


**Refresh**
<br>Refresh the parameter values by re-requesting all of them from the vehicle.

**Reset all to defaults**
<br>Reset all parameters to their original default values.

**Load from file / Save to file**
<br>Load parameters from an existing file or save your current parameter settings to a file.

**Clear RC to Param**
<br>This clears all associations between RC transmitter controls and parameters.
For more information see: [Radio Setup > Param Tuning Channels](../config/radio.md#param-tuning-channels).

**Reboot Vehicle**
<br>Reboot the vehicle (required after changing some parameters).
