## Forums and Chat

The core development team and community are active on the following forums and chat channels.

* [PX4 Discuss](https://discuss.px4.io//) (*recommended*)
* [Slack](https://px4.slack.com) ([join link](https://join.slack.com/t/px4/shared_invite/zt-si4xo5qs-R4baYFmMjlrT4rQK5yUnaA))

:::tip
Post on [PX4 Discuss](https://discuss.px4.io//) first! 
If you don't get a response in a few days then ping us on Slack with a link to your question (on discuss).

Discuss is better than slack in the first instance because questions and answers are permanent.

## Weekly Dev Call

:::tip
Developers are most welcome to attend the [weekly dev call](../contribute/dev_call.md) (and other [developer events](../README.md#calendar-events)) to engage more deeply with the project.

The [Dev Call](../contribute/dev_call.md) is a weekly meeting attended by the PX4 dev team to discuss platform technical details, coordinate activities and perform in-depth analysis.

There is also space in the agenda to discuss pull requests, major impacting issues and Q&A.


## Tests Flights

The Dronecode test team can help review (test flight) your pull requests and provide feedback and logs.

See [Test Flights](../test_and_ci/test_flights.md) for information about available test vehicles/autopilots, how to request flights, and response times.
