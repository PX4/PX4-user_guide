The PX4 dev team syncs up on platform technical details and in-depth analysis. 
There is also space in the agenda to discuss pull requests, major impacting issues and Q&A.


## Who should attend:

* Core project maintainers
* Component maintainers
* Test team lead
* Dronecode members
* Community members

> **Tip** The dev call is open to all interested developers (not just the core dev team). 
> This is a great opportunity to meet the team and contribute to the ongoing development of the platform.

## What gets discussed?

The first/main part of the meeting runs for 45 minutes and provides a high-level forum to discuss where the project is going. 

This is where we discuss *contributions*, including issues/PRs that have the [dev call](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/labels/devcall5) label.
We expect the proposer and the assigned reviewer to be on the call!

> **Note** The main call is designed to support rapid/focused decision making.
  We don't expect deep technical discussions and we will not spend extended amounts of time on feature requests. 
  Proposals are welcome, but they need a sponsor (someone willing to *implement* the work)!

The second part of the meeting is for in-depth technical discussions and open ended questions.
The core team/subsystem maintainers will be available for up to 45 additional minutes.
