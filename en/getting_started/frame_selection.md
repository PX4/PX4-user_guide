If you plan using PX4 for flying aircraft the most important question
you should answer is, what will be the application. Is it for fun or for
work, what is the planned flight times and coverage.

-   If you need precision hovering and you don't mind shorter flight
    times then focus on **Multicopters**.
-   For longer flights and larger areas of coverage you will need fixed
    wing aircraft i.e. **Airplanes**.
-   There is even mixed type of aircraft called **VTOL** - Vertical
    Takeoff and Landing aircraft. It can take off in vertical mode like
    Multicopter and then transition in forward flight like Airplane.

You can see our [airframe](http://px4.io/technology/airframes/) list
which is growing constantly with, frames that we tuned for perfect
flight with PX4 autopilot.

Once you select and buy or assemble your air-frame you will have to
preset it in QGroundControl with a template during the [Initial Setup
process](../config/autopilot_configuration.md).
