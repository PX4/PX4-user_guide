Autogyro ThunderFly AutoG2 is based on the RC model [Auto-G2](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/duraflytm-auto-g2-gyrocopter-w-auto-start-system-821mm-pnf.html) from HobbyKing. Model contains few parts, which is possible to 3D print. All additional parts are publickly on [github]() as open-source project. Printed parts are designed in [OpenSCAD]().

Durafly Auto-G2, in original design, has a three-blade rotor with 400 mm length blades with CLARK-Y profile. Rotor head allows tilting in ROLL axis. Autogyro has a controlled rudder and elevator. In the box with Durafly Auto-G2 autogyro you will find the autogyro polystyrene body, ESC, motor (probably 800kV), 4 servo, tail airfoils, 3 blades with rotor center parts, wire chassis and prerotator.

Modification of Durafly model are consist of the following:
 * Adding of autopilot
 * Rotor head with two axis of freedom (pitch, roll)
 * Two blade rotor with breakeable rotor center
 * Bigger wheels


## Modificaions
### Autopilot

### Rotor-head


### Two-blade rotor
Durafly autogyro has three-blade rotor. For AutoG2 we use two-blade rotor, because it has smaller vibration.

### Release device
If you want to start autogyro using the winch or if you want to start autogyro by towing you need to print release device. It is small box equipted with servo which pulls out the pin and releases the rope.
