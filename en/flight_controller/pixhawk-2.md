# Cube Flight Controller

The [Cube](https://pixhawk.org/modules/pixhawk2) flight controller (previously known as Pixhawk 2.1) is a flexible autopilot intended primarily for manufacturers of commercial systems. 
It is based on the [Pixhawk-project](https://pixhawk.org/) **FMUv3** open hardware design and runs PX4 on the [NuttX](http://nuttx.org) OS.

The controller is designed to be used with a domain-specific carrier board in order to reduce the wiring, improve reliability, and ease of assembly. 
For example, a carrier board for a commercial inspection vehicle might include connections for a companion computer, 
while a carrier board for a racer could includes ESCs form the frame of the vehicle.

Cube includes vibration isolation on two of the IMU's, with a third fixed IMU as a reference / Backup.

## Issues
At time of writing (October 2017) the CAN1 and CAN2 silk screen on the Pixhawk 2.1 is flipped (CAN1 is CAN2 and vice versa).
