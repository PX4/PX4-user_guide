This category is for experimental and discontinued autopilots (and autopilot "platforms") that are *not supported* by either the PX4 project team or by a manufacturer.

> **Tip** For more information about PX4 project autopilot board support levels see: [px4.io/autopilots/](https://px4.io/autopilots/).
