# DroPix Flight Controller

The Drotek<sup>&reg;</sup> *DroPix autopilot* is based on the [Pixhawk<sup>&reg;</sup>-project](https://pixhawk.org/) **FMUv2** open hardware design. It runs the PX4 Flight Stack on the [NuttX](http://nuttx.org) OS.

The DroPix system includes integrated multithreading, a Unix/Linux-like programming environment, completely new autopilot functions such as Lua scripting of missions and flight behavior, and a custom PX4 driver layer ensuring tight timing across all processes.
