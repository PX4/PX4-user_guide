# DroPix Flight Controller

The Drotek<sup>&reg;</sup> *DroPix autopilot* is based on the [Pixhawk<sup>&reg;</sup>-project](https://pixhawk.org/) **FMUv2** open hardware design. It runs the PX4 Flight Stack on the [NuttX](http://nuttx.org) OS.

The DroPix system includes integrated multithreading, a Unix/Linux-like programming environment, completely new autopilot functions such as Lua scripting of missions and flight behavior, and a custom PX4 driver layer ensuring tight timing across all processes.

## Building Firmware

> **Tip** Most users will not need to build this firmware!
  It is pre-built and automatically installed by *QGroundControl* when appropriate hardware is connected.

To [build PX4](https://dev.px4.io/en/setup/building_px4.html) for this target:
```
make px4_fmu-v2_default
```
