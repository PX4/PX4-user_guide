# Parrot Bebop

The [Parrot Bebop 2](http://global.parrot.com/au/products/bebop2/) is a popular flying camera. Basic support for PX4 has been added so that it can be used for research and testing.

> **Warning** Bebop support is at an early stage. To use PX4 with Bebop you will need to build the code using the developer toolchain.
