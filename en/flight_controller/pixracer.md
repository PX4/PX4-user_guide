# Pixracer

The Pixhawk XRacer board family is optimized for small racing quads and planes. In contrast to [Pixfalcon](../flight_controller/pixfalcon.md) and [Pixhawk](../flight_controller/pixhawk.md) it has in-built Wifi, new sensors, convenient full servo headers, CAN and supports 2M flash.

## Kit

The Pixracer is designed to use a separate avionics power supply. This is necessary to avoid current surges from motors or ESCs to flow back to the flight controller and disturb its delicate sensors.

  * Power module (with voltage and current sensing)
  * I2C splitter (supporting AUAV, Hobbyking and 3DR peripherals)
  * Cable kit for all common peripherals

## Wifi (no USB required)

One of the main features of the board is its ability to use Wifi for flashing new firmware, system setup and in-flight telemetry. This frees it of the need of any desktop system.

> **Todo** Setup and telemetry are already available, firmware upgrade is already supported by the default bootloader but not yet enabled
