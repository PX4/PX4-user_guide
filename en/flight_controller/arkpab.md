The ARK Pixhawk Autopilot Bus (PAB) Carrier is a USA-built flight controller carrier board, based on the [Pixhawk Autopilot Bus open source standard](https://github.com/pixhawk/Pixhawk-Standards).

The PAB form factor enables the ARK PAB Carrier to be used with any PAB-compatible flight controller, such as the [ARKV6X](../flight_controller/arkv6x.md).
