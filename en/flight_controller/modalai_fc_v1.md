# ModalAI Flight Core v1

The ModalAI Flight Core v1 is a flight controller for PX4, made in the USA.
The Flight Core can be paired with [ModalAI VOXL](https://docs.modalai.com/voxl-datasheet/) for obstacle avoidance and GPS-denied navigation, or used independently as a standalone flight controller.

## PX4 Firwmare Compatibility

*Flight Core v1* is fully compatible with the official PX4 Firmware from PX4 v1.11.

ModalAI maintains a [branched PX4 version](https://github.com/modalai/px4-firmware/tree/modalai-1.10) for PX4 v1.10.
This includes improvements in VIO and VOA that are planned to be upstreamed.

More information about the firmware can be found [here](https://docs.modalai.com/flight-core-firmware/).

## QGroundControl Support

This board supported in QGroundControl 4.0 and later.

## Availability

- Flight Core Complete Kit is available [here](https://shop.modalai.com/products/flight-core)
- Flight Core Board Only is available [here](https://shop.modalai.com/products/flight-core-pcb-only)
- Flight Core assembled with VOXL and cameras is available at [here](https://shop.modalai.com/products/voxl-flight-deck-r1)


## Quick Start

### Orientation

The diagram below shows the recommended orientation, which corresponds to `ROTATION_NONE` starting with PX4 v1.11 (and on the [ModalAI-maintained PX4 v1.10 branch](https://github.com/modalai/px4-firmware/tree/modalai-1.10))

![FlightCoreV1Orientation](../../assets/flight_controller/modalai/fc_v1/orientation.png)

> **Warning** For *PX4 v1.10* stable releases from *QGroundControl* use `ROTATION_YAW_180` for the above orientation.
