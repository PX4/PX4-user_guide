## Dimensions

All dimensions are in millimeters.

<!-- 
## Voltage Ratings

*Pixhawk 4* can be triple-redundant on the power supply if three power sources are supplied. The three power rails are: **POWER1**, **POWER2** and **USB**.

> **Note** The output power rails **FMU PWM OUT** and **I/O PWM OUT** (0V to 36V) do not power the flight controller board (and are not powered by it). You must supply power to one of **POWER1**, **POWER2** or **USB** or the board will be unpowered.

**Normal Operation Maximum Ratings**

Under these conditions all power sources will be used in this order to power the system:
1. **POWER1** and **POWER2** inputs (4.9V to 5.5V)
1. **USB** input (4.75V to 5.25V)
-->

<!-- 
**Absolute Maximum Ratings**

Under these conditions the system will not draw any power (will not be operational), but will remain intact.
1. **POWER1** and **POWER2** inputs (operational range 4.1V to 5.7V, 0V to 10V undamaged)
1. **USB** input (operational range 4.1V to 5.7V, 0V to 6V undamaged)
1. Servo input: VDD_SERVO pin of **FMU PWM OUT** and **I/O PWM OUT** (0V to 42V undamaged)

-->

## Assembly/Setup

The [Durandal Wiring Quick Start](../assembly/quick_start_durandal.md) provides instructions on how to assemble required/important peripherals including GPS, Power Management Board etc.


## Building Firmware

> **Tip** Most users will not need to build this firmware!
  It is pre-built and automatically installed by *QGroundControl* when appropriate hardware is connected.

To [build PX4](https://dev.px4.io/master/en/setup/building_px4.html) for this target:
```
make holybro_durandal-v1_default
```


## Debug Port

The PX4 FMU serial console and SWD interface run on the [Debug port](#debug_port).

The port has a standard serial pinout and can be connected to a standard FTDI cable (3.3V, but it's 5V tolerant) or a [Dronecode probe](https://kb.zubax.com/display/MAINKB/Dronecode+Probe+documentation).
The pinout uses the standard Dronecode debug connector pinout.
Please refer to the [wiring](https://dev.px4.io/master/en/debug/system_console.html) page for details of how to wire up this port.

> **Note** No Debug port is exposed for the I/O board.


## Peripherals

* [Digital Airspeed Sensor](https://drotek.com/shop/en/home/848-sdp3x-airspeed-sensor-kit-sdp33.html)
* [Telemetry Radio Modules](../telemetry/README.md)
* [Rangefinders/Distance sensors](../sensor/rangefinders.md)


## Supported Platforms / Airframes

Any multicopter / airplane / rover or boat that can be controlled with normal RC servos or Futaba S-Bus servos.

The complete set of supported configurations can be seen in the [Airframes Reference](../airframes/airframe_reference.md).
