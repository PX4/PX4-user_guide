# Aerotenna OcPoC-Zynq Mini Flight Controller

The [OcPoC-Zynq Mini](https://aerotenna.com/ocpoc-zynq/) is a FPGA+ARM SoC based flight control platform. OcPoC-Zynq's enhanced I/O flexibility and increased processing power makes it a great solution for commercial UAS developers and researchers. The FPGA's I/O flexibility allows for rapid sensor integration and customization of the flight controller hardware, allowing for capabilities such as triple redundancy in GPS, magnetometers, and IMUs. OcPoC-Zynq maintains also lightweight, compact footprint, leaving more space and weight on the airframe for sensor and peripheral expansion.

Main documentation is available on [Aerotenna's User Hub](https://aerotenna.readme.io/docs/ocpoc-mini-zynq-specifications) for hardware setup, FAQs, and various tutorials including FPGA and kernel development.

## Pinouts and SD Card Setup

Pinouts for the default OcPoC-Zynq configuration and full step-by-step instructions for first time setup are available on [Aerotenna's User Hub](https://aerotenna.readme.io/docs/ocpoc-mini-zynq-specifications).

## Building PX4 for OcPoC-Zynq

After setting up the PX4 development environment and cloning the [PX4 Firmware](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware), you can build PX4 for OcPoC-Zynq with the following commands:

  * For Aerotenna's default ubuntu-armhf root file system:
    ```
    make posix_ocpoc_ubuntu
    ```
  * For Petalinux:
    ```
    make posix_ocpoc_cross
    ```

See the user hub page [PX4 on OcPoC Zynq Mini](https://aerotenna.readme.io/docs/px4-setup) for full step-by-step instructions for first time setup of PX4 on OcPoC-Zynq. Note: At the present time PX4 firmware must be built from source as no pre-built binaries for OcPoC-Zynq are supplied through QGroundControl.
