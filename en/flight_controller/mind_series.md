* [MindPX](../flight_controller/mindpx.md) - revised schematic and structure, and been further enhanced with new features to make un-manned vehicle more smart and friendly to use.
* [MindRacer](../flight_controller/mindracer.md) - a fully stackable flight platform for miniature UAVs.
  * This is a platform, which currently has two RTF vehicles: [MindRacer 210](../flight_controller/mindracer210.md) and [NanoMind 110](../flight_controller/nanomind110.md)


> **Tip** At time of writing, *MindPX* firmware is not available for download through *QGroundControl*.
  To use these boards you will have to build the firwmare yourself (using the same [NuttX toolchain](https://dev.px4.io/en/setup/building_px4.html#nuttx--pixhawk-based-boards) as Pixhawk.
