# CUAV V5+ Autopilot

*V5+*<sup>&reg;</sup> is an advanced autopilot manufactured by CUAV<sup>&reg;</sup>.
It was designed by CUAV<sup>&reg;</sup> in collaboration with the PX4 team.

The autopilot is recommended for commercial systems integration, but is also suitable for academic research and any other use.

Some of its main features include:
- Full compatibility with the [Pixhawk project](https://pixhawk.org/) **FMUv5** design standard and uses the [Pixhawk Connector Standard](https://pixhawk.org/pixhawk-connector-standard/) for all external interfaces.
- More advanced processor, RAM and flash memory than FMU v3, along with more stable and reliable sensors.
- Firmware-compatible with PX4.
- Modular design allows users to customize their own carrier board.
- Built-in vibration dampening system with high performance shock absorption system.
- Multiple-redundant sensor and power systems for improved flight safety and stability.

## Voltage Ratings

*V5+ AutoPilot* can be triple-redundant on the power supply if three power sources are supplied.
The three power rails are: **POWER1**, **POWER2** and **USB**.

> **Note** The output power rails **FMU PWM OUT** and **I/O PWM OUT** (0V to 36V) do not power the flight controller board (and are not powered by it).
  You must supply power to one of **POWER1**, **POWER2** or **USB** or the board will be unpowered.

**Normal Operation Maximum Ratings**

Under these conditions all power sources will be used in this order to power the system:
1. **POWER1** and **POWER2** inputs (4.3V to 5.4V)
1. **USB** input (4.75V to 5.25V)

## Building Firmware

> **Tip** Most users will not need to build this firmware!
  It is pre-built and automatically installed by *QGroundControl* when appropriate hardware is connected.

To [build PX4](https://dev.px4.io/en/setup/building_px4.html) for this target:
```
make px4_fmu-v5_default
```

## Debug Port

The system's serial console and SWD interface operate on the **FMU Debug** port.
Simply connect the FTDI cable to the Debug & F7 SWD connector (the product list contains the CUAV FTDI cable).
It does not have an i/o debug interface.
