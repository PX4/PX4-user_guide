## Flashing PX4

After setting up the PX4 development environment, follow these steps to put the PX4 software on the CF2:

1. Grab source code of the PX4 [Bootloader](https://github.com/PX4/Bootloader)
1. Compile using: `make crazyflie_bl`
1. Put the CrazyFly 2 (CF2) into DFU mode by following these steps:
   - Ensure it is initially unpowered
   - Hold down button
   - Plug into computer's USB port
   - After a second, the blue LED should start blinking and after 5 seconds should start blinking faster
   - Release button
1. Flash bootloader using dfu-util: `sudo dfu-util -d 0483:df11 -a 0 -s 0x08000000 -D ./build/crazyflie_bl/crazyflie_bl.bin` and unplug CF2 when done
   - If successful, then the yellow LED should blink when plugging in again
1. Grab the [Firmware](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware)
1. Compile with `make crazyflie_default upload`
1. When prompted to plug in device, plug in CF2: the yellow LED should start blinking indicating bootloader mode. Then the red LED should turn on indicating that the flashing process has started.
1. Wait for completion
1. Done! Calibrate via QGC

> **Note** If QGC does not connect with the vehicle, ensure that in [nuttx-config](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/platforms/nuttx/nuttx-configs/crazyflie/nsh/defconfig#L934) for crazyflie `# CONFIG_DEV_LOWCONSOLE is not set` is replaced by `CONFIG_DEV_LOWCONSOLE=y`

## Wireless Setup Instructions

The onboard nRF module allows connecting to the board via Bluetooth or through the proprietary 2.4GHz Nordic ESB protocol.

- A [Crazyradio PA](https://www.bitcraze.io/crazyradio-pa/) is recommended.
- To fly the CF2 right away, the Crazyflie phone app is supported via Bluetooth

Using the official Bitcraze **Crazyflie phone app**:

- Connect via Bluetooth
- Change mode in settings to 1 or 2
- Calibrate via QGC

Connecting via **MAVLink**:

- Use a Crazyradio PA alongside a compatible GCS
- Clone the [crazyflie-lib-python](https://github.com/barzanisar/crazyflie-lib-python/tree/cfbridge) and checkout its cfbridge branch: `git checkout cfbridge`

>**Note** This fork of crazyflie-lib-python contains [cfbridge.py](https://github.com/barzanisar/crazyflie-lib-python
/blob/cfbridge/examples/cfbridge.py) which is taken from [here](https://github.com/dennisss/cfbridge). Cfbridge allows wireless 
Mavlink communication between CF2 (flashed with PX4) and QGC by enabling QGC to communicate with the crazyradio PA. The [C based 
cfbridge](https://github.com/dennisss/cfbridge) is currently experiencing data loss issues, which is why we have chosen to use 
cfbridge.py.

- Make sure you have set the udev permissions to use the USB Radio. To do this, follow the steps listed [here](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-lib-python#setting-udev-permissions) and **restart** your computer.
- Connect a Crazyradio PA via USB.
- Build a [virtualenv (local python environment)](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) with package dependencies using one of the following methods:

**Method 1:**
  - Enter the following:
    ```
    pip install virtualenv
    pip install tox
    ```
  - Navigate to the crazyflie-lib-python folder.
  - `pip install -e .`
  - `virtualenv venv` for linux or `python -m virtualenv venv` for Mac OSX
  - Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
  - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Method 2:** 
For systems that support [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Simple-Makefile.html), follow this alternative:
 * `pip install tox`
 * Navigate to the crazyflie-lib-python folder.
 * `make venv`
 * Activate the virtual environment: `source venv-cflib/bin/activate`

To **launch cfbridge** everytime:
- Switch on CF2 (which is already flashed with PX4 firmware) by pressing its ON button and wait for it to boot up.
- Connect a Crazyradio PA via USB.
- Navigate to the crazyflie-lib-python folder.
- Activate the environment: `source venv-cflib/bin/activate` or `source venv/bin/activate` depending on the name of the venv folder you have.
- `cd examples`
- Launch cfbridge: `python cfbridge.py`
- Open QGC.
- After using cfbridge, you can deactivate the virtualenv if you activated it by pressing `CTRL+z`. Most of the time, launching cfbridge again from the same terminal doesn't connect to crazyflie, this can be solved by closing the terminal and relaunching cfbridge in a new terminal. 

> **Tip** If you change any driver in [crazyflie-lib-python](https://github.com/barzanisar/crazyflie-lib-python/tree/cfbridge) 
or if launching cfbridge in a new terminal does not find crazyflie, you can try navigating to the crazyflie-lib-python folder and 
run `make venv` to rebuild cflib.

> **Note** To use Joystick, set COM_RC_IN_MODE in QGC to "Joystick/No RC Checks". Calibrate the Joystick and set the Joystick 
message frequency in QGC to any value between 5 to 14 Hz (10 Hz is recommended). This is the rate at which Joystick commands are 
sent from QGC to CF2. (To do this, you will need to follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/mavlink/qgroundcontrol) to 
obtain the latest QGC source code (master) and build it.)

## Hardware Setup

Crazyflie is able to fly with precise control in Stabilised, Altitude and Position modes. 

* You will need the [Z-ranger deck](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/decks/products/z-ranger-deck) to fly in Altitude mode. If you also want to fly in the Position mode, it is recommended you buy the [Flow deck](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/decks/products/flow-deck) which also has the Z-ranger sensor integrated in it.
* The onboard barometer is highly susceptible to any external wind disturbances including those created by crazyflie's own propellers. Hence, we isolated the barometer with a piece of foam and then mounted the distance sensor on top of it as shown below:

![](../../assets/hardware/hardware-crazyflie-barometer.jpg)

![](../../assets/hardware/hardware-crazyflie-baro-foam.jpg)

![](../../assets/hardware/hardware-crazyflie-opticalflow.jpg)

In order to log flight details, you can mount SD card deck on top of crazyflie as shown below:

![](../../assets/hardware/hardware-crazyflie-sdcard.jpg)

Then, you need to stick the battery on top of the SD card deck using a double sided tape:

## Altitude Control 

Crazyflie is able to fly in Altitude mode if you use a [Z-ranger deck](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/decks/products/z-
ranger-deck), connected to the board on I2C interface. The driver for this range finder is called "vl53lxx.cpp" which publishes 
range readings on a uORB topic, named "distance_sensor". The maximum height (above ground) the range finder can sense lies in the 
range of 0.5 to 1 m, depending on the reflective property of the ground surface. This means you cannot hold altitudes above this 
range in Altitude or Position flight modes.

> **Tip** If in Altitude or Position mode, the crazyflie height drifts at mid-throttle command, first try rebooting the vehicle. If this does not fix the problem, recalibrate the accel and mag (compass).  

> **Note** Since the onboard barometer is highly susceptible to wind disturbances created by the crazyflie's own propellers, you cannot rely on it to hold Altitude. 

## Position Control 

With [Flow deck](https://store.bitcraze.io/collections/decks/products/flow-deck), you can fly crazyflie in Position mode. The driver for this sensor is called "pmw3901.cpp", which publishes the flow readings on the "optical_flow" uORB topic. Unlike PX4flow, the flow deck does not house a gyro, hence the onboard gyro is used for flow fusion to find the local position estimates. Moreover, the flow deck shares the same SPI bus as the SD card deck, therefore logging at high rate on SD card is not recommended when flying in Position mode. A ulog for flight in Position mode is available [here](https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=a0e68bf1-e905-410f-b828-f6146dba9d45).


## Using FrSky Taranis RC Transmitter as Joystick

If you already own a Taranis RC transmitter and want to use it as a controller, it can be configured as a USB Joystick:

- Create a new model in Taranis.

  ![](../../assets/hardware/transmitters/hardware-crazyflie-taranis-model.jpg)

- In “MODEL SETUP” menu page, turn off both internal and external TX modules.

  ![](../../assets/hardware/transmitters/hardware-crazyflie-taranis-modelSetup.jpg)

- In “OUTPUTS” menu page (also called “SERVOS” page in some Taranis transmitters), invert Throttle (CH1) and Aileron (CH3).

  ![](../../assets/hardware/harware-crazyflie-taranis-outputs.jpg)
  

To use Taranis switches to arm/disarm and switch to different flight modes:

- In Taranis UI “MIXER” menu page, you can assign the switches to any channel in the range channel 9-16 which map to the buttons 0-7 in the QGC Joystick setup. For example, Taranis “SD” switch can be set to channel 9 in Taranis UI:

  ![Taranis switch setup](../../assets/hardware/transmitters/hardware-crazyflie-taranis-switchSetup.jpg)

- Connect Taranis to PC with a USB cable and Open QGC. 
- In QGC Joystick Setup, you can see the buttons turning yellow when you switch them on. For example, channel 9 in Taranis maps to button 0 in QGC Joystick setup. You can assign any mode to this button e.g. Altitude mode. Now when you lower the switch "SD", flight mode will change to Altitude.

### ROS
To connect to the crazyflie via mavros:

- Start up cfbridge using the above instructions.
- Change the UDP port QGC listens to:
  - In QGC, navigate to **Application Settings > General** and uncheck all the boxes under "Autoconnect to the following devices".
  - Add in **Comm Links** a link of type "UDP", check the "Automatically Connect on Start" option, change the "Listening Port" to 14557, add Target Hosts: 127.0.0.1 and then press ok.
- Make sure you have [mavros](https://github.com/mavlink/mavros/tree/master/mavros#installation) installed.
- Start mavros with a command: `roslaunch mavros px4.launch fcu_url:="udp://:14550@127.0.0.1:14551" gcs_url:="udp://@127.0.0.1:14557"`
- Restart QGC if it doesn't connect.
