# Drive Modes (Rover)

Drive modes (aka "Flight modes") provide autopilot support to make it easier to manually drive the vehicle, to execute autonomous missions, or to defer control to an external system.

Available rover drive modes available depend on the vehicle type:

- [Ackermann Rover (v2)](../frames_rover/ackermann_rover_v2.md#flight-modes)
- [Ackermann Rover (v1)](../frames_rover/ackermann_rover_v1.md#drive-modes)
- [Differential Steering Rover](../frames_rover/differential_rover_v1.md#drive-modes)
