# Path Planning Offboard Interface

PX4 uses a number of MAVLink interfaces for integrating path planning services from a companion computer (including obstacle avoidance in missions, [safe landing](../computer_vision/safe_landing.md), and future services):
- The [MAVLink Path Planning Protocol](https://mavlink.io/en/services/trajectory.html) message [TRAJECTORY_REPRESENTATION_WAYPOINTS](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#TRAJECTORY_REPRESENTATION_WAYPOINTS) is used to sent the current and next waypoint, and receive a stream of setpoints for the new path.
- The [HEARTBEAT/Connection Protool](https://mavlink.io/en/services/heartbeat.html) is used for "proof of life" detection.
- [LOCAL_POSITION_NED](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#LOCAL_POSITION_NED) and [ALTITUDE](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#ALTITUDE) send the vehicle local position and altitude, respectively.

> **Tip** The message flows from PX4 UORB topics, through MAVLink, to ROS and back again are all documented in: [PX4/avoidance > Message Flows](https://github.com/PX4/avoidance#message-flows).


All services that use this interface send and receive messages of the same type/format.
Developers can therefore use this interface to create their own new companion-side path planning services, or tweak the existing planner software.


## PX4 Configuration

Path planning is activated in PX4 by [setting](../advanced_config/parameters.md) the [COM_OBS_AVOID](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#COM_OBS_AVOID) to 1.

## Companion Computer Setup

Companion-side hardware setup and hardware/software configuration is provided in the [PX4/avoidance](https://github.com/PX4/avoidance#obstacle-detection-and-avoidance) Github repo.

The actual setup/configuration required depends on the planner being used.

> **Warning** Only one planner can run on the companion computer at a time (at time of writing).
  This means that offboard features that use different planners cannot be enabled on the same vehicle. a vehicle at the same time (e.g. a vehicle can support obstacle avoidance and collision prevent, but not also safe landing - or visa versa).


## Trajectory Interface

PX4 sends information about the *desired path* to the companion computer (when `COM_OBS_AVOID=`, in modes for which the path planning interface has been integrated), and receives back a stream of setpoints for the *planned path*.
The path information is, in both cases, transported in [TRAJECTORY_REPRESENTATION_WAYPOINTS](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#TRAJECTORY_REPRESENTATION_WAYPOINTS) messages.

### PX4 MAVLink Interface

PX4 sends the desired path in `TRAJECTORY_REPRESENTATION_WAYPOINTS` messages at 5Hz.

The fields set by PX4 as shown:
- `time_usec`: UNIX Epoch time.
- `valid_points`: 3
- Point 0 - Current waypoint *type adapted* by FlightTaskAutoMapper (see [notes below](#type_adapted)):
  - `pos_x[0]`, `pos_y[0]`, `pos_z[0]`: Type adapted x-y-z NED local position of *current* mission waypoint.
  - `vel_x[0]`, `vel_y[0]`, `vel_z[0]`: Type adapted x-y-z NED local velocity of *current* mission waypoint.
  - `acc_x[0]`, `acc_y[0]`, `acc_z[0]`: NaN
  - `pos_yaw[0]`: Current yaw angle
  - `vel_yaw[0]`: NaN
  - `command[0]`: The [MAVLink Command](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#mavlink-commands-mavcmd) for the current waypoint. 
- Point 1 - Current waypoint (Unmodified/not type adapted)):
  - `pos_x[1]`, `pos_y[1]`, `pos_z[1]`: x-y-z NED local position of *current* mission waypoint
  - `vel_x[1]`, `vel_y[1]`, `vel_z[1]`: NaN
  - `acc_x[1]`, `acc_y[1]`, `acc_z[1]`: NaN
  - `pos_yaw[1]`: Yaw setpoint
  - `vel_yaw[1]`: Yaw speed setpoint
  - `command[1]`: The [MAVLink Command](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#mavlink-commands-mavcmd) for the current waypoint.
- Point 2 - Next waypoint in local coordinates (unmodified/not type adapted):
  - `pos_x[2]`, `pos_y[2]`, `pos_z[2]`: x-y-z NED local position of *next* mission waypoint
  - `vel_x[2]`, `vel_y[2]`, `vel_z[2]`: NaN
  - `acc_x[2]`, `acc_y[2]`, `acc_z[2]`: NaN
  - `pos_yaw[2]`: Yaw setpoint
  - `vel_yaw[2]`: Yaw speed setpoint
  - `command[2]`: The [MAVLink Command](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#mavlink-commands-mavcmd) for the next waypoint.
- All other indices/fields are set as NaN.

<span id="type_adapted"></span>
Notes:
- Point 0 is the current waypoint/target modified based on the type of target.
  For example, it makes sense when landing to specify the target x, y coordinates and a descent velocity.
  To achieve this `FlightTaskAutoMapper` modifies land waypoints in Point 0 to set the z component of position to NAN and the z-velocity to a desired value.
- Point 1 and 2 are not used by the safe landing planner.
- Point 1 is used by local and global planner.

### Companion MAVLink Interface

On the companion side, MAVROS translates the MAVLink message into ROS messages, which are eventually handled by the appropriate planner.
The planner plans a path to the waypoint/target, and sends it to the vehicle as a stream of `TRAJECTORY_REPRESENTATION_WAYPOINTS` messages that have the setpoint in Point 0.

The fields for the messages from the companion computer are set as shown:
- `time_usec`: UNIX Epoch time.
- `valid_points`: 1
- Current vehicle information:
  - `pos_x[0]`, `pos_y[0]`, `pos_z[0]`: x-y-z NED vehicle local position setpoint
  - `vel_x[0]`, `vel_y[0]`, `vel_z[0]`: x-y-z NED velocity setpoint
  - `acc_x[0]`, `acc_y[0]`, `acc_z[0]`: NaN
  - `pos_yaw[0]`: Yaw angle setpoint
  - `vel_yaw[0]`: Yaw speed setpoint
  - `command[0]`: NaN.
- All other indices/fields are set as NaN.

A planner that implements this interface must:
- Emit setpoints at more than 2Hz when receiving messages from PX4.
  PX4 will enter [Hold mode](../flight_modes/hold.md) if no message is received for more than 0.5s.
- Mirror back setpoints it receives when it doesn't support planning for the current vehicle state (e.g. the local planner would mirror back messages sent during safe landing, because it does not support Land mode).


## Companion Failure Handling

PX4 safely handles the case where messages are not received from the offboard system:
- If no planner is running and `COM_OBS_AVOID` is enabled at/from boot: 
  - preflight checks will fail (irrespective of vehicle mode) and it won't fly until `COM_OBS_AVOID` is set to 0.
- If no planner is running and `COM_OBS_AVOID` is enabled after boot: 
  - the vehicle will run normally in manual modes
  - if you switch to an autonomous mode (e.g. Land Mode) it will immediately fall back to [Hold mode](../flight_modes/hold.md).
- When external path planning is enabled
  - if the `HEARTBEAT` is lost PX4 will emit a status message (which is displayed in *QGroundControl*) stating either "Avoidance system lost" or "Avoidance system timeout" (depending on the vehicle state). This is irrespective of the current flight mode.
  - if a trajectory message is not received for more than 0.5 seconds and the vehicle is in an autonomous mode (Return, Mission, Takeoff, Land), the vehicle will switch into [Hold mode](../flight_modes/hold.md).
  > **Note** A planner must always provide points in this timeframe.
    - A planner will mirror back setpoints it receives when the vehicle is in a mode/state for which it doesn't provide path planning. (i.e. the vehicle will follow its desired path, delayed by a very small amount).
