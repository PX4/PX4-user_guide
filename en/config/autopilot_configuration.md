# Autopilot Configuration

The initial configuration is explained in detail in the video below.
[Download QGroundControl](http://qgroundcontrol.org/downloads) and
install it on your desktop computer. Then start the configuration
process. It consists of these major steps:

- Selecting the airframe in which the autopilot is installed (plane,
  multicopter, VTOL, etc)
- Calibrating the autopilot's sensors and selecting the right mounting
  orientation
- Calibrating the radio control (if one should be used, PX4 can be
  flown with tablets only as well)
- Selecting which switches of the radio control should switch the
  system between different flight modes

If you encounter difficulties with the configuration, you can try our
