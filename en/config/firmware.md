# Loading Firmware

*QGroundControl* **desktop** versions can be used to install PX4 firmware onto [Pixhawk-series](../getting_started/flight_controller_selection.md) flight-controller boards. 

> **Caution** **Before you start installing Firmware** all USB connections to you vehicle must be *disconnected* (both direct or through a telemetry radio). The vehicle must *not be* powered by a battery.


To install the firmware update:

1. First select the **Gear** icon (*Vehicle Setup*) in the top toolbar and then **Firmware** in the sidebar.

1. Connect the flight controller directly to your computer via USB. 

   > **Note** Connect directly to a powered USB port on your machine (do not connect through a USB hub).

1. Once the controller is connected you can choose which firmware to load (*QGroundControl* presents sensible options based on the connected hardware). Accept the default setting to install the latest stable version of PX4.

   > **Tip** If another autopilot is pre-installed, select the **PX4 Flight Stack ... Release** option to select PX4.

1. Click the **OK** button to start the update.

   The firmware will then proceed through a number of upgrade steps (downloading new firmware, erasing old firmware etc.). Each step is printed to the screen and overall progress is displayed on a progress bar.

   Once the firmware has completed loading, the device/vehicle will reboot and reconnect.

Next you will need to specify the [vehicle airframe](../config/airframe.md) (and then sensors, radio, etc.)


> **Tip** QGroundControl will install the current stable version of PX4, but you can also choose to install beta builds, daily builds, or custom firmware files.
