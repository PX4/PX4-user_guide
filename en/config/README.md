# Basic Configuration

This section contains *essential* configuration topics, including how to install firmware onto the flight controller hardware and configure the core sensors that PX4 needs to be present on every vehicle (compass, GPS, gyro etc.)

The [Advanced Configuration](../advanced_config/README.md) section contains more advanced topics, related to lesser-used sensors and peripherals, and to vehicle/parameter tuning.
