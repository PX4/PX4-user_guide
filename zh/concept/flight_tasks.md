# Flight Tasks

*Flight Tasks* are used within [Flight Modes](../concept/flight_modes.md) to provide specific movement behaviours: e.g. follow me, or flight smoothing.

At time of writing the best description of how flight modes work (in PX4 v1.9) is provided in the following video: **PX4 Flight Task Architecture Overview** - Dennis Mannhart, Matthias Grob (*PX4 Developer Summit 2019*).
