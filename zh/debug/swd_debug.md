# SWD (JTAG) Hardware Debugging Interface

PX4 usually runs on autopilot controller hardware that provides an ARM *Serial Wire Debug (SWD)* interface. SWD is a low pin-count physical interface for JTAG debugging on ARM-processors. It can be used with an SWD-compatible debug probe (e.g. [Segger J-Link EDU Mini](#segger_jlink_edu_mini), [Dronecode Probe](#dronecode_probe), etc.) to set breakpoints in PX4 and step through the code running on a real device.

The SWD interface can also be used to add a new bootloader and/or firmware on a completely empty board (one that does not have the USB bootloader installed).

This topic explains how to connect the SWD interface on different boards (debugging itself is then covered in the associated [debugging topics](#debugging_topics)).

## SWD Interface Definition

The SWD interface consists of the following pins.

| 针脚      | Signal Type | 参数描述                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `参考压`   | 输出          | Target reference voltage.<br>Some JTAG adapters require the `Vref` voltage to set the voltage on the SWD lines. For example, [SEGGER J-Link Debug Probes](#segger_jlink_edu_mini) require `Vref`. |
| `SWDIO` | I/O         | Single bi-directional data pin.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `SWCLK` | 输出          | Clock signal.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `GND`   | -           | Ground pin.                                                                                                                                                                                             |


While not "part" of SWD, an autopilot may also have an *Serial Wire Output (SWO)* trace output pin. If present this should also be connected.

| 针脚    | Signal Type | 参数描述                                                                                                           |
| ----- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SWO` | 输出          | Serial  Wire Output trace output pin. This may be used in combination with *SWD* to emit real-time trace data. |


## Connecting SWD Debuggers to PX4 Hardware

Flight controllers commonly provide a single debug port that exposes both the [SWD Interface](#swd_interface) and [System Console](../debug/system_console.md). This must be connected to an SWD [debug probe](#debug_probes) using an "appropriate" connector.

This connector may come with your flight controller or debug probe. Other options are given below.

### Holybro Pixhawk Debug Adapter

The [Holybro Pixhawk Debug Adapter](https://holybro.com/products/pixhawk-debug-adapter) is _highly recommended_ when debugging controllers that use one of the Pixhawk-standard debug connectors.

It is the easiest way to connect:
- Flight controllers that use either the [Pixhawk Debug Full](#pixhawk_debug_port_10_pin_sh) (10-pin SH) or [Pixhawk Debug Mini](#pixhawk-debug-mini-6-pin-sh-debug-port) (6-pin SH) debug port, and
- SWD debug probes that support the 10-pin ARM compatible interface standard used by the [Segger JLink Mini](#segger-jlink-edu-mini-debug-probe) or 20-pin compatible with the Segger Jlink or STLink.

![Holybro Pixhawk Debug Adapter](../../assets/debug/holybro_pixhawk_debug_adapter.png)

### Debug Probe Adapters

Some SWD [debug probes](#debug_probes) come with adapters/cables for connecting to common Pixhawk [debug ports](#debug_ports). Probes that are known to come with connectors are listed below:

- [DroneCode Probe](#dronecode-probe): comes with a connector for attaching to the [Pixhawk Debug Mini](#pixhawk_debug_port_6_pin_sh)

### Board-specific Adapters

Some manufacturers provide cables to make it easy to connect the SWD interface and [System Console](../debug/system_console.md).

- [CUAV V5nano](../flight_controller/cuav_v5_nano.md#debug_port) and [CUAV V5+](../flight_controller/cuav_v5_plus.md#debug-port) include this debug cable:

![6-pin JST SH Cable](../../assets/debug/cuav_v5_debug_cable.jpg)

### Custom Cables

You can also create custom cables for connecting to different boards or probes:
- Connect `SWDIO`, `SWCLK` and `GND` pins on the debug probe to the corresponding pins on the autopilot.
- Connect the `VRef` pin, if required by the debug adapter that is being used.
- Connect the `SWO` pin, if present.

:::tip
Where possible, we highly recommend that you create or obtain an adapter board rather than custom cables for connecting to SWD/JTAG debuggers and computers.
This reduces the risk or poor wiring contributing to debugging problems, and has the benefit that adapters usually provide a common interface for connecting to multiple popular flight controller boards.

## Autopilot Debug Ports

Flight controllers commonly provide a single debug port that exposes both the [SWD Interface](#swd_interface) and [System Console](../debug/system_console.md).

The [Pixhawk Connector Standards](#pixhawk_standard_debug_ports) formalize the port that must be used in each FMU version. However there are still many boards that use different pinouts or connectors, so we recommend you check the [documentation for your autopilot](../flight_controller/README.md) to confirm port location and pinout.

The debug port location and pinouts for a subset of autopilots are linked below:

## Pixhawk Connector Standard Debug Ports

The Pixhawk project has defines a standard pinout and connector type for different Pixhawk FMU releases:

:::tip
Check your [specific board](#port_information) to confirm the port used.

### Pixhawk Debug Mini (6-Pin SH Debug Port)

The [Pixhawk Connector Standard](https://github.com/pixhawk/Pixhawk-Standards/blob/master/DS-009%20Pixhawk%20Connector%20Standard.pdf) defines the _Pixhawk Debug Mini_, a *6-Pin SH Debug Port* that provides access to both SWD pins and the [System Console](../debug/system_console.md).

This is used in FMUv4 and FMUv5.

The pinout is as shown below (SWD pins highlighted):

| Debug调试端口 | 针脚         |
| --------- | ---------- |
| 1         | `Vtref`    |
| 2         | Console TX |
| 3         | Console RX |
| 4         | `SWDIO`    |
| 5         | `SWDCLK`   |
| 6         | `GND`      |

The debug port definition includes the following solder pads (on board next to connector):

| Debug调试端口 | 针脚                | Voltage |
| --------- | ----------------- | ------- |
| Pad       | 信号                | 电压      |
| 1         | NRST (reset)      | +3.3V   |
| 2         | GPIO1 (free GPIO) | +3.3V   |
| 3         | GPIO2 (free GPIO) | +3.3V   |

The socket is a *6-pin JST SH* - Digikey number: [BM06B-SRSS-TBT(LF)(SN)](https://www.digikey.com/products/en?keywords=455-2875-1-ND) (vertical mount), [SM06B-SRSS-TBT(LF)(SN)](https://www.digikey.com/products/en?keywords=455-1806-1-ND)(side mount).

You can connect to the debug port using a [cable like this one](https://www.digikey.com/products/en?keywords=A06SR06SR30K152A).

![6-pin JST SH Cable](../../assets/debug/cable_6pin_jst_sh.jpg)


<a id="pixhawk_debug_port_10_pin_sh"></a>

### Pixhawk Debug Full (10-Pin SH Debug Port)

The [Pixhawk Connector Standard](https://github.com/pixhawk/Pixhawk-Standards/blob/master/DS-009%20Pixhawk%20Connector%20Standard.pdf) defines _Pixhawk Debug Full_, a *10-Pin SH Debug Port* that provides access to both SWD pins and the [System Console](../debug/system_console.md). This essentially moves the solder pads from beside the [Pixhawk Debug Mini](#pixhawk_debug_port_6_pin_sh) into the connector, and also adds an SWO pin.

This port is specified for use in FMUv5x, FMUv6, FMUv6x.

The pinout is as shown below (SWD pins highlighted):

| Debug调试端口 | 针脚         |
| --------- | ---------- |
| 1         | `Vtref`    |
| 2         | Console TX |
| 3         | Console RX |
| 4         | `SWDIO`    |
| 5         | `SWDCLK`   |
| 6         | *SWO*      |
| 7         | NFC GPIO   |
| 8         | PH11       |
| 9         | nRST       |
| 10        | `GND`      |

The socket is a *10-pin JST SH* - Digikey number: [BM10B-SRSS-TB(LF)(SN)](https://www.digikey.com/products/en?keywords=455-1796-2-ND) (vertical mount) or [SM10B-SRSS-TB(LF)(SN)](https://www.digikey.com/products/en?keywords=455-1810-2-ND) (side mount).

You can connect to the debug port using a [cable like this one](https://www.digikey.com/products/en?keywords=A10SR10SR30K203A).

## Debug Probes

The following section outlines some popular debug probes and adaptors for connecting them to autopilots running PX4.


<a id="segger_jlink_edu_mini"></a>

### Segger JLink EDU Mini Debug Probe

The [Segger JLink EDU Mini](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/models/j-link-edu-mini/) is an inexpensive and popular SWD debug probe. The probe's connector pinout looks like the image below (connect to this using an ARM 10-pin mini connector like [FTSH-105-01-F-DV-K](https://www.digikey.com/products/en?keywords=SAM8796-ND)).

![connector_jlink_mini.png](../../assets/debug/connector_jlink_mini.png)

The pin mapping to connect the J-Link Edu Mini to [Pixhawk Debug Mini](#pixhawk_debug_port_6_pin_sh) is shown below (note, the `-` indicates a pin that is not required for SWD).

| Debug调试端口      | J-Link Mini |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| 1 (Vtref)      | 1           |
| 2 (Console TX) | -           |
| 3 (Console RX) | -           |
| 4 (SWDIO)      | 2           |
| 5 (SWDCLK)     | 4           |
| 6 (GND)        | 3 or 5      |

:::tip
From the table above you can infer the connections for autopilots that do not use the standard port.

<a id="dronecode_probe"></a>

### Dronecode Probe

The [Dronecode Probe](https://kb.zubax.com/display/MAINKB/Dronecode+Probe+documentation) is a generic JTAG/SWD + UART console adapter compatible with most ARM Cortex based designs, and in particular with Pixhawk series flight controllers (and other hardware that PX4 supports).

The probe's USB interface exposes two separate virtual serial port interfaces: one for connecting to the [System Console](../debug/system_console.md) (UART) and the other for an embedded GDB server (SWD interface).

The probe provides a DCD-M connector cable for attaching to the [Pixhawk Debug Mini](#pixhawk_debug_port_6_pin_sh).

:::note
The *6-pos DF13* connector that comes with the probe cannot be used for SWD debugging (it is for using the System Console).
:::

:::note
The *Dronecode Probe* is based on the [Black Magic Probe](#black_magic_probe).
:::

<a id="black_magic_probe"></a>

### Black Magic Probe

The [Black Magic Probe](https://github.com/blacksphere/blackmagic/wiki) is much like the [Dronecode probe](#dronecode_probe) but does not come with the same adapters for directly connecting to Pixhawk series flight controllers.

Adapters can be purchased separately:
- [Drone Code Debug Adapter](https://1bitsquared.com/products/drone-code-debug-adapter) (1 BIT SQUARED).
