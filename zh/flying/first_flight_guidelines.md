# 首次飞行指南

学习飞行 </0 > 很有趣! 这些指南旨在确保您的首次飞行体验愉快、有教育意义且安全。</p> 

## 选择合适的地点

为您的第一次飞行选择正确的位置至关重要。 要注意的主要事项是:

- 确保空间是开放的。 附近没有高大的树木、山丘或建筑物，因为它会影响 GPS 接收。
- 确保100米内没有人。
- Make sure there is nothing that you shouldn't crash onto within 100 m / 300 feet - no houses, structures, cars, water, corn fields (hard to find drones in).

:::note
100m clearance is a good "rule of thumb", but you should also ensure you comply with flight regulations in your area.

## 带一个专家

Bring someone with experience for your first flight. Get them to help you to run through the pre-flight checks and let them intervene if something goes wrong!

## Plan the Flight

Plan the flight before taking off. Make sure you know the whole route and where/how the vehicle will land.

## Limit the Damage

Damaging property or injuring people with your UAV can have significant legal and financial consequences (far in excess of the value of the UAV itself).

The UAV should always be manually flown within a safe zone where there are no obstacles or people, and it must be clearly visible at all times.

If you start to lose control over the vehicle, and cannot bring it back under control, crash it in an empty area as soon as possible.

:::note
It can be useful to [set a safety switch on your transmitter](../config/safety.md#safety_switch). This allows you to immediately return or crash your drone if necessary.
