# 首次飞行指南

学习飞行 </0 > 是一个很大的乐趣! 这些指南旨在确保您的第一次飞行体验是愉快的、有教育意义的和安全的。</p> 

## 选择合适的地点

为您的第一次飞行选择正确的位置至关重要。 要注意的主要事项是:

- 确保空间是宽敞的。 周围没有高的树, 丘陵或建筑物, 因为它会影响 gps 接收。
- 确保100米/300 英尺内没有人。
- 确保周围（100米/300 英尺内）没有房子, 建筑, 汽车, 水域, 玉米地 (很难找到无人机)。

## 带一个专家

在您的第一次飞行时，带一个有经验的人。 Get them to help you to run through the pre-flight checks and let them intervene if something goes wrong!

## Plan the Flight

Plan the flight before taking off. Make sure you know the whole route and where/how the vehicle will land.

## Limit the Damage

Damaging property or injuring people with your UAV can have significant legal and financial consequences (far in excess of the value of the UAV itself).

The UAV should always be manually flown within a safe zone where there are no obstacles or people, and it must be clearly visible at all times.

If you start to lose control over the vehicle, and cannot bring it back under control, crash it in an empty area as soon as possible.

> **Note** It can be useful to [set a safety switch on your transmitter](../config/safety.md#safety_switch). This allows you to immediately return or crash your drone if necessary.

## Arm the Drone

To arm the drone, put the throttle stick in the bottom right corner. This will start the propellers on a multicopter. To disarm, put the throttle stick in the bottom left corner. Alternatively arming and disarming can also be performed in QGroundControl (PX4 does not require a radio control for flying autonomously).
