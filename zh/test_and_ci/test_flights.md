# 测试飞行

测试飞行对于质量保证很重要。

When submitting [Pull Requests](../contribute/code.md#pull-requests) for new functionality or bug fixes you should provide information about the feature-relative tests performed, along with accompanying flight logs.

For significant changes to the system you should also run general flight tests using the test cards listed below.

## 测试卡

These test cards define "standard" flight tests. These are run by the test team as part of release testing, and for more significant system changes.

- [测试 MC_01 - 手动模式](../test_cards/mc_01_manual_modes.md)
- [MC_02 - 完全自主](../test_cards/mc_02_full_autonomous.md)
- [测试 MC_03 - 自动手动混合](../test_cards/mc_03_auto_manual_mix.md)
- [MC_04 - 故障安全测试](../test_cards/mc_04_failsafe_testing.md)
