For more interface information, please read [V5+ Manual](http://manual.cuav.net/V5-Plus.pdf).

![V5+ AutoPilot](../../assets/flight_controller/cuav_v5_plus/connection/v5+_quickstart_02.png)

:::note
If the controller cannot be mounted in the recommended/default orientation (e.g. due to space constraints) you will need to configure the autopilot software with the orientation that you actually used: [Flight Controller Orientation](../advanced_features/rtk-gps.md).
:::

## GPS + 罗盘 + 安全开关 + LED

The recommended GPS module is the *Neo v2 GPS*, which contains GPS, compass, safety switch, buzzer, LED status light.

:::note
Other GPS modules may not work (see [this compatibility issue](../flight_controller/cuav_v5_nano.md#compatibility_gps)\)).
:::

The GPS/Compass module should be mounted on the frame as far away from other electronics as possible, with the direction marker towards the front of the vehicle (*Neo v2 GPS* arrow is in the same direction as the flight control arrow). Connect to the flight control GPS interface using a cable.

:::note
If you use the [NEO V2 PRO GNSS (CAN GPS)](http://doc.cuav.net/gps/neo-v2-pro/en/#enable), please use the cable to connect to the flight control CAN interface.

## 安全开关

The dedicated safety switch that comes with the V5+ is only required if you are not using the recommended *Neo V2 GPS* (which has an inbuilt safety switch).

If you are flying without the GPS you must attach the switch directly to the `GPS1` port in order to be able to arm the vehicle and fly (if you use the old 6-pin GPS, please read the definition of the bottom interface to change the line).

## 蜂鸣器

If you do not use the recommended GPS, the buzzer may not work.

## 遥控器

A remote control (RC) radio system is required if you want to manually control your vehicle (PX4 does not require a radio system for autonomous flight modes). You will need to select a compatible transmitter/receiver and then bind them so that they communicate (read the instructions that come with your specific transmitter/receiver).

The figure below shows how you can access your remote receiver (please find the SBUS cable in the kit).

![V5+ AutoPilot](../../assets/flight_controller/cuav_v5_plus/connection/v5+_quickstart_04.png)

## Spektrum 卫星接收器

The V5+ has a dedicated DSM cable. If using a Spektrum satellite receiver, this should be connected to the flight controller DSM/SBUS/RSSI interface.

## 电源

The V5+ kit includes the *HV\_PM* module, which supports 2~14S LiPo batteries. Connect the 6pin connector of the *HW\_PM* module to the flight control `Power1` interface.

:::warning
The supplied power module is unfused. Power **must** be turned off while connecting peripherals.
:::

![V5+ AutoPilot](../../assets/flight_controller/cuav_v5_plus/connection/v5+_quickstart_01.png)

:::note
The power module is not a power source for peripherals connected to the PWM outputs. If you're connecting servos/actuators you will need to separately power them using a BEC.
:::

## Telemetry System (Optional)

A telemetry system allows you to communicate with, monitor, and control a vehicle in flight from a ground station (for example, you can direct the UAV to a particular position, or upload a new mission).

The communication channel is via Telemetry Radios. The vehicle-based radio should be connected to either the `TELEM1` or `TELEM2` port (if connected to these ports, no further configuration is required). The other radio is connected to your ground station computer or mobile device (usually via USB).

<span id="sd_card"></span>

## SD 卡

An [SD card](../getting_started/px4_basic_concepts.md#sd_cards) is inserted in the factory (you do not need to do anything).

## 电机

Motors/servos are connected to the MAIN and AUX ports in the order specified for your vehicle in the [Airframes Reference](../airframes/airframe_reference.md).
