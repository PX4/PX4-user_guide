# RTK GPS

[Real Time Kinematic (RTK)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_Kinematic) increases the accuracy of GNSS/GPS systems to centimeter-level. RTK allows PX4 to be used in applications like precision surveying, where pinpoint accuracy is essential.

PX4 supports a number of RTK GPS devices. It requires *QGroundControl* running on a laptop/PC and a vehicle with a WiFi or Telemetry radio link to the laptop.

Information about supported devices and setup can be found in the section: [Peripheral Hardware](../gps_compass/rtk_gps.md).
