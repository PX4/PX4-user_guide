We'd love your help to translate *QGroundControl*, and our guides for PX4, *QGroundControl* and MAVLink!

Our docs (and *QGroundControl*) use the [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com) online tool for translation. Crowdin automatically imports source topics from Github and presents new and changed strings for translation and/or review (approval). Crowdin automatically imports source topics from Github and presents new and changed strings for translation and/or review (approval).

Crowdin exports the translated documents back out to Github as a "Pull Request" (which the development team periodically review and accept). The exported output contains the source document with any translated and approved text replaced with translated strings (i.e. if a string is not translated/is changed, then it will be displayed in English).

:::tip
You will need a (free) [Crowdin account](https://crowdin.com/join) account to join the translation team!

Gitbook uses special prefix text to indicate Notes, Tips and Warnings (e.g. `> **Note**`, `> **Tip**`, `> **Warning**`). This is displayed in Crowdin as shown: Readers will not be mislead by old and out of date translations.

## 特别注意事项

### 不要修改句首的 Note, Tip, Warning 字样

Vuepress uses `:::` to mark the beginning of notes, tips and warning:
```html
:::tip
The text for the tip.
:::
```
The text for `:::tip` or `:::warning` etc. should not be modified as it defines the colour of the notebox.

## 添加新语言

If the language you want to translate is not available then you will need to request it by contacting the project owner (there is a contact link on each project's home page).

:::warning
Maintaining a translation is hard! Before you ask us to create a new language, please find a few other people to help you translate!
