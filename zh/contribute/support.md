:::tip
Post on [PX4 Discuss](https://discuss.px4.io//) first! If you don't get a response in a few days then ping us on Slack with a link to your question (on discuss).

Discuss is better than slack in the first instance because questions and answers are permanent.

Developers are most welcome to attend the [weekly dev call](../contribute/dev_call.md) (and other [developer events](../README.md#calendar-events)) to engage more deeply with the project.
