# RTK GPS Heading with Dual u-blox F9P

Two u-blox F9P [RTK GPS](../gps_compass/rtk_gps.md) modules mounted on a vehicle can be used to accurately compute a heading angle (i.e. an alternative to compass-based heading estimation). The two GPS devices in this scenario are referred to as the *Moving Base* and *Rover*.

## Supported Devices

This feature works on F9P devices that expose the GPS UART2 port (access to the port is required for setup).

:::note
- [Freefly RTK GPS](../gps_compass/rtk_gps_freefly.md) and [Holybro H-RTK F9P GNSS](../gps_compass/rtk_gps_holybro_h-rtk-f9p.md) cannot be used because they do not expose the UART2 port.
- Supported devices are also listed in [GPS/Compass > Supported GPS and/or Compass](../gps_compass/README.md#supported-gps-and-or-compass).

## Setup

Ideally the two antennas should be identical, on the same level/horizontal plane and oriented the same way, and on an identical ground plane size and shape ([Application note](https://www.u-blox.com/sites/default/files/ZED-F9P-MovingBase_AppNote_%28UBX-19009093%29.pdf), section *System Level Considerations*).
- The application note does not state the minimal required separation between modules (50cm has been used in test vehicles running PX4).
- The antennas can be positioned as needed, but the [GPS_YAW_OFFSET](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#GPS_YAW_OFFSET) must be configured: [GPS > Configuration > GPS as Yaw/Heading Source](../gps_compass/README.md#configuring-gps-as-yaw-heading-source).

In overview:
- The UART2 of the GPS devices need to be connected together (TXD2 of the "Moving Base" to RXD2 of the "Rover")
- Connect UART1 on each of the GPS to (separate) unused UART's on the autopilot, and configure both of them as GPS with baudrate set to `Auto`. The mapping is as follows:
  - Main GPS = Rover
  - Secondary GPS = Moving Base
- Set [GPS_UBX_MODE](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#GPS_UBX_MODE) to `Heading` (1)
- [EKF2_AID_MASK](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_AID_MASK) parameter bit 7 must be set (see [GPS > Configuration > GPS as Yaw/Heading Source](../gps_compass/README.md#configuring-gps-as-yaw-heading-source)).
- [GPS_YAW_OFFSET](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#GPS_YAW_OFFSET) may need to be set (see [GPS > Configuration > GPS as Yaw/Heading Source](../gps_compass/README.md#configuring-gps-as-yaw-heading-source)).
- Reboot and wait until both devices have GPS reception. `gps status` should then show the Main GPS going into RTK mode, which means the heading angle is available.


:::note
If using RTK with a fixed base station the secondary GPS will show the RTK state w.r.t. the base station.
