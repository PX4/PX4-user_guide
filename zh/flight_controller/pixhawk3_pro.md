## Building Firmware

> **Tip** Most users will not need to build this firmware! It is pre-built and automatically installed by *QGroundControl* when appropriate hardware is connected.

To [build PX4](https://dev.px4.io/master/en/setup/building_px4.html) for this target:

    make px4_fmu-v4pro_default
    

## Debug Port

The board has FMU and IO debug ports as shown below.

![Debug Ports](../../assets/flight_controller/pixhawk3pro/pixhawk3_pro_debug_ports.jpg)

The pinouts and connector comply with the [Pixhawk Standard Debug Port](https://pixhawk.org/pixhawk-connector-standard/#dronecode_debug) (JST SM06B connector).

| Pin     | Signal           | Volt  |
| ------- | ---------------- | ----- |
| 1 (red) | VCC TARGET SHIFT | +3.3V |
| 2 (blk) | CONSOLE TX (OUT) | +3.3V |
| 3 (blk) | CONSOLE RX (IN)  | +3.3V |
| 4 (blk) | SWDIO            | +3.3V |
| 5 (blk) | SWCLK            | +3.3V |
| 6 (blk) | GND              | GND   |

For information about wiring and using this port see:
