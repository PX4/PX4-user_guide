# Community Supported, Experimental & Discontinued Autopilots

For more information about PX4 project autopilot board support levels see: [px4.io/autopilots/](https://px4.io/autopilots/).

## Community Supported Autopilots

- [Cube Orange](../flight_controller/cubepilot_cube_orange.md) (CubePilot)
- [Cube Yellow](../flight_controller/cubepilot_cube_yellow.md) (CubePilot)

Boards in this category are fully supported, but are not following industry standards and might have sole-source supply chain risks. See the [list of Pixhawk standard boards](../flight_controller/autopilot_pixhawk_standard.md) for a list of products that are officially supported by PX4 and are following industry standards.

## Experimental Autopilots

This category is for experimental and discontinued autopilots (and autopilot "platforms") that are *not supported* by either the PX4 project team or by a manufacturer.

- [Aerotenna OcPoC-Zynq Mini](../flight_controller/ocpoc_zynq.md)
- [BeagleBone Blue](../flight_controller/beaglebone_blue.md)
- [Raspberry Pi 2/3 Navio2](../flight_controller/raspberry_pi_navio2.md)
- [Raspberry Pi 2/3/4 PilotPi Shield](../flight_controller/raspberry_pi_pilotpi.md)

Boards in this category must work with at least one PX4 release for a defined vehicle type. They may not be compatible with the current PX4 release, and compatibility is not maintained by the project for future releases.

## Experimental Vehicles

These are [complete vehicles](../complete_vehicles/README.md) that have a fully integrated autopilot and other hardware (i.e. unlike the other autopilots listed, you can't use them in your own builds). They are listed in this page because from a PX4 software perspective, they are another autopilot.
- [Bitcraze Crazyflie 2.0](../complete_vehicles/crazyflie2.md) ([Complete Vehicle](../complete_vehicles/README.md))
- [Bitcraze Crazyflie 2.1](../complete_vehicles/crazyflie21.md) ([Complete Vehicle](../complete_vehicles/README.md))


## Discontinued

- [CUAV v5](../flight_controller/cuav_v5.md) (Pixhawk FMUv5)
- [Holybro Pixfalcon](../flight_controller/pixfalcon.md) (Pixhawk FMUv2)
- [IntelÂ® Aero RTF Drone](../complete_vehicles/intel_aero.md) ([Complete Vehicle](../complete_vehicles/README.md))
- [mRo AUAV-X2](../flight_controller/auav_x2.md)  (Pixhawk FMUv2)
- [Qualcomm Snapdragon Flight](../flight_controller/snapdragon_flight.md) ([Complete Vehicle](../complete_vehicles/README.md))
- [3DR Pixhawk 1](../flight_controller/pixhawk.md) (Pixhawk FMUv2)
