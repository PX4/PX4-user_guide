# Complete Vehicles.

This section contains information about complete vehicles that run PX4.

It includes

- Consumer drones running PX4 that are supported and maintained by the project (many other vehicles don't need "explicit" support from the project because they are compatible with the FMU standard used by Pixhawk series boards, or are supported outside the PX4 project): 
  - [Crazyflie 2.0](../flight_controller/crazyflie2.md)
  - [Parrot Bebop](../flight_controller/bebop.md)
  - BetaFPV Beta75X 2S Brushless Whoop
  - Teal One
- Hardware reference platforms that use PX4. 
  - [Intel® Aero Ready to Fly Drone](../flight_controller/intel_aero.md) - UAV development platform with high-end autopilot and integrated onboard computer.
