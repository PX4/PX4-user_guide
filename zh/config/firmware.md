*QGroundControl* **desktop** versions can be used to install PX4 firmware onto [Pixhawk-series](../getting_started/flight_controller_selection.md) flight-controller boards.

:::warning
**Before you start installing Firmware** all USB connections to the vehicle must be *disconnected* (both direct or through a telemetry radio). The vehicle must *not be* powered by a battery.
:::

## 安装稳定的PX4版本

Generally you should use the most recent *released* version of PX4, in order to benefit from bug fixes and get the latest and greatest features.

:::tip
This is the version that is installed by default.
:::

To install PX4:

1. Start *QGroundControl* and connect the vehicle.
1. Select **"Q" icon > Vehicle Setup > Firmware** (sidebar) to open *Firmware Setup*.

   ![Firmware disconnected](../../assets/qgc/setup/firmware/firmware_disconnected.jpg)

1. Connect the flight controller directly to your computer via USB.

   :::note
Connect directly to a powered USB port on your machine (do not connect through a USB hub).
:::

1. Select the **PX4 Flight Stack X.x.x Release** option to install the latest stable version of PX4 *for your hardware* (autodetected).

   ![Install PX4 default](../../assets/qgc/setup/firmware/firmware_connected_default_px4.jpg)

1. Click the **OK** button to start the update.

   The firmware will then proceed through a number of upgrade steps (downloading new firmware, erasing old firmware etc.). Each step is printed to the screen and overall progress is displayed on a progress bar.

   Once the firmware has completed loading, the device/vehicle will reboot and reconnect.

:::tip
If *QGroundControl* installs the FMUv2 target (see console during installation) and you have a newer board, you may need to [update the bootloader](#bootloader) in order to access all the memory on your flight controller.
:::

Next you will need to specify the [vehicle airframe](../config/airframe.md) (and then sensors, radio, etc.)

## 安装PX4 Master, Beta或自定义固件

To install a different version of PX4:
1. Connect the vehicle as above, and select **PX4 Flight Stack vX.x.x Stable Release** ![安装 PX4 版本](../../assets/qgc/setup/firmware/qgc_choose_firmware.jpg)
1. Check **Advanced settings** and select the version from the dropdown list:
   - **Standard Version (stable):** The default version (i.e. no need to use advanced settings to install this!)
   - **Beta Testing (beta):** A beta/candidate release. 只有当新版本准备完毕时才可用。
   - **Developer Build (master):** The latest build of PX4/PX4-Autopilot.
   - **Custom Firmware file...:** A custom firmware file (e.g. that you have built locally). 如果选择 Custom firmware file ，您需要在下一步中从文件系统中选择自定义固件。

Firmware update then continues as before.

## FMUv2 Bootloader 更新

If *QGroundControl* installs the FMUv2 target (see console during installation), and you have a newer board, you may need to update the bootloader in order to access all the memory on your flight controller.

:::note
Early FMUv2 [Pixhawk-series](../flight_controller/pixhawk_series.md#fmu_versions) flight controllers had a [hardware issue](../flight_controller/silicon_errata.md#fmuv2-pixhawk-silicon-errata) that restricted them to using 1MB of flash memory. The problem is fixed on newer boards, but you may need to update the factory-provided bootloader in order to install FMUv3 Firmware and access all 2MB available memory.
:::

To update the bootloader:

1. 插入 SD 卡（启用引导日志记录，便于调试任何可能的问题。）
1. [Update the Firmware](../config/firmware.md) to PX4 *master* version (when updating the firmware, check **Advanced settings** and then select **Developer Build (master)** from the dropdown list). *QGroundControl* will automatically detect that the hardware supports FMUv2 and install the appropriate Firmware.

   ![FMUv2 更新](../../assets/qgc/setup/firmware/bootloader_update.jpg)

   等待飞控重启。
1. [找到并启用](../advanced_config/parameters.md) 参数 [SYS_BL_UPDATE](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#SYS_BL_UPDATE)。
1. 重新启动（断开/重新连接飞控板）。 Bootloader更新只需要几秒钟即可完成。
1. 然后再重新 [更新固件](../config/firmware.md) 。 This time *QGroundControl* should autodetect the hardware as FMUv3 and update the Firmware appropriately.

   ![FMUv3 更新](../../assets/qgc/setup/firmware/bootloader_fmu_v3_update.jpg)

:::note
If the hardware has the *Silicon Errata* it will still be detected as FMUv2 and you will see that FMUv2 was re-installed (in console). In this case you will not be able to install FMUv3 hardware.

For more information see [Bootloader Update](../advanced_config/bootloader_update.md).
