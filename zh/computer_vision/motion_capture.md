# 运动捕捉（MoCap）

运动捕捉（MoCap）是一种使用 *外部* 定位设备，用于估计载具三维*姿态*（位置与方向）的 [计算机视觉](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision)技术。 It is commonly used to navigate a vehicle in situations where GPS is absent (e.g. indoors), and provides position relative to a *local* co-ordinate system.

*MoCap* systems most commonly detect motion using infrared cameras, but other types of cameras, Lidar, or Ultra Wideband (UWB) may also be used.

:::tip
Note *MoCap* is conceptually similar to [Visual Intertial Odometry (VIO)](../computer_vision/visual_inertial_odometry.md). The main difference is that in VIO the vision system runs on the vehicle, and additionally makes use of the vehicle IMU to provide velocity information.
