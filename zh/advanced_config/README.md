# Advanced Configuration

This section contains advanced configuration topics, covering vehicle-specific tuning, and less-common sensors and peripherals.

> **Tip** 如果要创建新的机架类型或大幅度修改已支持的机架，这些主题将非常有用。 Generally if you're using a [supported airframe](../airframes/airframe_reference.md#copter) (e.g. from [QGroundControl > Airframe](../config/airframe.md)) the default tuning and configuration should be acceptable.

For the standard configuration appropriate to every vehicle see: [Basic Configuration](../config/README.md).
