# uORB Publication/Subscription Graph

This page provides a uORB publication/subscription graph that shows the communication between modules. It is based on information that is extracted directly from the source code. Usage instructions are provided [below](#graph-properties).

## Graph Properties

The graph has the following properties:

- Modules are shown in gray with rounded corners while topics are displayed as coloured rectangular boxes.
- Associated modules and topics are connected by lines. Dashed lines indicate that the module publishes the topic, while solid lines indicate that the module subscribes to the topic.
- Some modules and topics are excluded:
  - Topics that are subscribed/published by many modules: `parameter_update`, `mavlink_log` and `log_message`.
  - The set of logged topics.
  - Topics that have no subscriber or no publisher.
  - Modules in **src/examples**.
- Hovering over a module/topic highlights all its connections.
- Double-clicking on a topic opens its message definition.
- Make sure your browser window is wide enough to display the full graph (the sidebar menu can be hidden with the icon in the top-left corner). You can also zoom the image.
- The *Preset* selection list allows you to refine the list of modules that are shown.
- The *Search* box can be used to find particular modules/topics (topics that are not selected by the search are greyed-out).
