## Wiring

The wiring below is valid for Pixhawk and Pixracer. Use the main outputs, not the ones labeled with AUX. The motor controller needs to have an in-built BEC, as the autopilot is not powering the servo rail.

| Port   | Connection                  |
| ------ | --------------------------- |
| RC IN  | PPM or S.BUS / S.BUS2 input |
| MAIN 1 | Left Aileron                |
| MAIN 2 | Right Aileron               |
| MAIN 3 | Empty                       |
| MAIN 4 | Throttle                    |

## Build Log

The images below give a rough idea about the assembly process, which is simple and can be done with a hot glue gun.
