# Ignition Gazebo Simulation

:::warning
Ignition Gazebo supports a single frame (quadcopter) and world (July 2021).
:::

[Ignition Gazebo](https://ignitionrobotics.org/libs/gazebo) is an open source robotics simulator from the [Ignition Robotics Project](https://ignitionrobotics.org/home). It is derived from the popular robotics simulator [Gazebo](./gazebo.md), featuring more advanced rendering, physics and sensor models.

**Supported Vehicles:** Quadrotor

See [Simulation](../simulation/README.md) for general information about simulators, the simulation environment, and simulation configuration (e.g. supported vehicles).

## Installation (Ubuntu Linux)

:::note
These instructions were tested on Ubuntu 18.04 and Ubuntu 20.04
:::

1. Install the usual [Development Environment on Ubuntu LTS / Debian Linux](../dev_setup/dev_env_linux_ubuntu.md).
1. Install Ignition Gazebo following the [installation instructions](https://github.com/Auterion/px4-simulation-ignition#readme) (`sudo` may be required):
   ```sh
   sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable `lsb_release -cs` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list'
   wget http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
   apt update
   apt install ignition-edifice
   ```

## Running the Simulation

Ignition Gazebo SITL simulation can be conveniently run through a `make` command as shown below:
```bash
cd /path/to/PX4-Autopilot
make px4_sitl ignition
```
This will run both the PX4 SITL instance and the ignition gazebo client

The supported vehicles and `make` commands are listed below (click on the links to see the vehicle images).

| Vehicle         | Command                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------ |
| quadrotor(iris) | `make px4_sitl ignition` |

The commands above launch a single vehicle with the full UI. *QGroundControl* should be able to automatically connect to the simulated vehicle.

In order to run the simulation without running the ignition gazebo gui, one can use the `HEADLESS=1` flag. For example, the following
```
HEADLESS=1 make px4_sitl ignition
```

In order to increase the verbose output, `VERBOSE_SIM=1` can be used.
```
VERBOSE_SIM=1 make px4_sitl ignition
```
