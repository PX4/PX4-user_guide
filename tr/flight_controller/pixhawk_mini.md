# Pixhawk Mini Overview

> **Warning** Under construction. Requires connection diagrams and more images of ports

The 3DR *Pixhawk Mini* autopilot is a next-generation evolution of the Pixhawk (designed by 3DR in collaboration with HobbyKing). It is about 1/3rd the size of the original Pixhawk and has more powerful processors and sensors.

The Pixhawk Mini is based on the PX4 open-hardware project and has been optimized for the PX4 flight stack.

## Product comparisons

### Pixhawk Mini vs Pixhawk (original)

- One-third the size - from 50x81.5x15.5mm to 38x43x12mm.
- Rev 3 processor for full utilization of 2MB flash memory.
- Improved sensors, both primary and secondary IMU MPU9250 and ICM20608 respectively. The result is more stable, more reliable flight and navigation.
- GPS+Compass module included. Features the Neo M8N with GLONASS support; compass HMC5983. Expect faster and stronger GPS lock.
- Micro JST connectors instead of DF-13. These are much easier to work with.
- Integrated piezo speaker and safety switch.
- Natively supports 4S batteries with the included PDB.

### Pixhawk Mini vs Pixfalcon

- Improved sensors, both primary and secondary IMU MPU9250 and ICM20608 respectively. Expect better vibration handling and reliability.
- CAN interface for UAVCAN support.
- Includes 8-channel breakout servo rail for planes and other vehicles requiring powered PWM output.
- Includes I2C breakout board for a total of 5 I2C connections.
- Similar size.

Pixhawk Mini features an advanced processor and sensor technology from ST Microelectronics® and a NuttX real-time operating system, delivering excellent performance, flexibility, and reliability for controlling any autonomous vehicle.
