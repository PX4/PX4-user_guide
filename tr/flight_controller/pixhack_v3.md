# Pixhack V3

The CUAV *Pixhack V3* flight controller board is a flexible autopilot intended primarily for manufacturers of commercial systems.

The board is a variant of the SOLO Pixhawk<sup>&reg;</sup> 2 (PH2) flight controller, which is in turn based on the [Pixhawk-project](https://pixhawk.org/) **FMUv3** open hardware design. It runs PX4 on the [NuttX](http://nuttx.org) OS, and is fully compatible with both PX4 or ArduPilot<sup>&reg;</sup> (APM) firmware.

*Pixhack V3* has significant improvements with respect to the original design, including better interface layout and the addition of vibration damping and a thermostat system.

## Building Firmware

> **Tip** Most users will not need to build this firmware! It is pre-built and automatically installed by *QGroundControl* when appropriate hardware is connected.

To [build PX4](https://dev.px4.io/en/setup/building_px4.html) for this target:

    make px4_fmu-v3_default
