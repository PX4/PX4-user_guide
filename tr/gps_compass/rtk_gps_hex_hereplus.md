# HEX/ProfiCNC Here+ RTK GPS

The [Here+ RTK GPS receiver](http://www.proficnc.com/content/12-here) is a small, light and energy efficient [RTK GPS module](../gps_compass/rtk_gps.md), based on the u-blox M8P. Using RTK, PX4 can get its position with centimetre-level accuracy, which is much more accurate than can be provided by a normal GPS.

## Purchase

* [ProfiCNC](http://www.proficnc.com/gps/77-gps-module.html)
* [Hex - China](http://www.hex.aero/shop/all/here-rtk-gnss-set/) (China)

## Configuration

RTK setup and use on PX4 via *QGroundControl* is largely plug and play (see [RTK GPS](../advanced_features/rtk-gps.md) for more information).

## Wiring and Connections

The Here+ GPS comes with an 8 pin connector that can be inserted directly into the [Pixhawk 2](http://www.hex.aero/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DRS_Pixhawk-2-17th-march-2016.pdf) GPS UART port.

The Pixhawk 3 Pro and Pixracer have a 6 pin GPS port connector. For these controllers you can modify the GPS cable (as shown below) to remove pin 6 and 7.

Pin 6 and 7 are for the safety button - these can be attached as well if needed.

### Pinout

The Here+ GPS pinout is provided below. This can be used to help modify the connector for other autopilot boards.
