# Drotek XL RTK GPS

The [Drotek XL RTK GPS receiver](https://drotek.com/shop/en/home/792-xl-rtk-gps-neo-m8p-rover.html) is a competitively priced [RTK GPS module](../gps_compass/rtk_gps.md) that can be configured as either base or rover. Using RTK, PX4 can get its position with centimetre-level accuracy, which is much more accurate than can be provided by a normal GPS.
