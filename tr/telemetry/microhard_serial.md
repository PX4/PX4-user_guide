# Microhard Serial Telemetry Radios

[Microhard Pico Serial Radios](http://microhardcorp.com/P900.php) enable MAVLink communication between a radio on a vehicle and a GCS.

They support modes including point to point, point to multi-point, and mesh modes, and can provide a secure/encrypted channel. The range depends on a number of factors including power output, antennas, and the selected baud rate.

Several manufacturers provide solutions based on these radios:
* [ARK Electron Microhard Serial Telemetry Radio](../telemetry/arkflow_microhard_serial.md)
* [Holybro Microhard P900 Telemetry Radio](../telemetry/holybro_microhard_p900_radio.md)
