# Compass Calibration

The compass calibration process configures all connected internal and external [magnetometers](../gps_compass/README.md). *QGroundControl* will guide you to position the vehicle in a number of set orientations and rotate the vehicle about the specified axis.

> **Note** If you are using an external magnetometer/compass (e.g. a compass integrated into a GPS module) make sure you mount the external compass on your vehicle properly and connect it to the autopilot hardware. Instructions for connecting your GPS+compass can be found in [Basic Assembly](../assembly/README.md) for your specific autopilot hardware. Once connected, QGroundControl will automatically detect the external magnetometer.

## Performing the Calibration

The calibration steps are:

1. Start *QGroundControl* and connect the vehicle.
2. Select the **Gear** icon (Vehicle Setup) in the top toolbar and then **Sensors** in the sidebar.
3. Click the **Compass** sensor button.

    > **Note** You should already have set the [Autopilot Orientation](../config/flight_controller_orientation.md). If not, you can also set it here.

4. Click **OK** to start the calibration.

5. Place the vehicle in any of the orientations shown in red (incomplete) and hold it still. Once prompted (the orientation-image turns yellow) rotate the vehicle around the specified axis in either/both directions. Once the calibration is complete for the current orientation the associated image on the screen will turn green.

6. Repeat the calibration process for all vehicle orientations.

Once you've calibrated the vehicle in all the positions *QGroundControl* will display *Calibration complete* (all orientation images will be displayed in green and the progress bar will fill completely). You can then proceed to the next sensor.
