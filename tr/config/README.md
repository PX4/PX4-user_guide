# Basic Configuration

*QGroundControl* is used to install [firmware](../config/firmware.md) onto the flight controller hardware, specify an [airframe](../config/airframe.md), and configure the core sensors that PX4 needs to be present on every vehicle (compass, GPS, gyro etc.).

:::tip
Before starting this section you should [Download QGroundControl](http://qgroundcontrol.com/downloads/) and install it on your **desktop** computer (*QGroundControl* does not support vehicle configuration on mobile platforms).
:::

This section contains *essential* configuration topics:

* [Firmware](../config/firmware.md)
* [Airframe](../config/airframe.md)
* [Sensor Orientation](../config/flight_controller_orientation.md)
* [Compass](../config/compass.md)
* [Gyroscope](../config/gyroscope.md)
* [Accelerometer](../config/accelerometer.md)
* [Airspeed](../config/airspeed.md) (fixed-wing/VTOL)
* [Level Horizon Calibration](../config/level_horizon_calibration.md)
* [Radio Setup](../config/radio.md)
* [Joystick Setup](../config/joystick.md)
* [Flight Modes](../config/flight_mode.md) (Optional)
* [Battery](../config/battery.md) (optional)
* [Safety](../config/safety.md) (optional)
* [Motors/Servos](../config/motors.md)

:::note
For a [supported airframe](../config/airframe.md) only this basic configuration is required. If you're creating a new airframe you will additionally need to perform vehicle tuning (see [Advanced Configuration](../advanced_config/README.md)).
