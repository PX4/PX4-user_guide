# Flight Log Analysis

This topic outlines approaches and software packages that can be used to analyze PX4 flight logs.

## Reporting Flights

[Flight Reporting](../getting_started/flight_reporting.md) explains how to download a log and report/discuss issues about a flight with the development team.

## Structured Analysis

Before analyzing a flight log it is important to establish its context:

* If the analysis is done after a malfunction, did the log capture the crash or did it stop mid-air?
* Did all controllers track their references? The easiest way to establish this is to compare attitude roll and pitch rates to their set points.
* Does the sensor data look valid? Was there very strong vibration \(a reasonable threshold for strong vibration is anything with a peak-to-peak of more than 2-3 m/s/s\).
* If the root cause is not specific to the vehicle make sure to report it with a link to the log file \(and video if one exists\) on the [PX4 issue tracker](https://github.com/px4/firmware/issues/new).

## Ruling Out Power Failures

If a log file ends mid-air, two main causes are possible: a power failure *or* a hard fault of the operating system.

On autopilots based on the [STM32 series](http://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers/stm32-32-bit-arm-cortex-mcus.html?querycriteria=productId=SC1169), hard faults of the operating system are logged to the SD card. These are located on the top level of the SD card and named *fault\_date.log*, e.g. **fault\_2017\_04\_03\_00\_26\_05.log**. Please always check for the presence of this file if a flight log ends abruptly.

## Analysis Tools

### Flight Review (Online Tool)

[Flight Review](http://logs.px4.io) is the successor of *Log Muncher*. It is used in combination with the new [ULog](http://dev.px4.io/en/log/ulog_file_format.html) logging format.

Key features:

* Web based, great for end-users.
* User can upload, load and then share report with others.
* Interactive plots.

See [Log Analysis using Flight Review](flight_review.md) for an introduction.

### pyulog

[pyulog](https://github.com/PX4/pyulog) is a python package to parse ULog files, along with a set of command-line scripts to extract/display ULog information and convert them to other file formats.

Key features:

* Python library for parsing ULog files. Base library used by a number of other ULog analysis and visualisation tools.
* Scripts to extract/display ULog information: 
  * *ulog_info*: display information from an ULog file.
  * *ulog_messages*: display logged messages from an ULog file.
  * *ulog_params*: extract parameters from an ULog file.
* Scripts to convert ULog files to other formats: 
  * *ulog2csv*: convert ULog to (several) CSV files.
  * *ulog2kml*: convert ULog to (several) KML files.

All scripts are installed as system-wide applications (i.e. they be called on the command line - provided Python is installed), and support the `-h` flag for getting usage instructions. For example:

    $ ulog_info -h
    usage: ulog_info [-h] [-v] file.ulg
    
    Display information from an ULog file
    
    positional arguments:
      file.ulg       ULog input file
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help     show this help message and exit
      -v, --verbose  Verbose output
    

Below we see the kind of information exported from a sample file using *ulog_info*.

    $ ulog_info sample.ulg

    Dropouts: count: 4, total duration: 0.1 s, max: 62 ms, mean: 29 ms
