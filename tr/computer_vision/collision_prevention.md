# Collision Prevention

*Collision Prevention* may be used to automatically slow and stop a vehicle before it can crash into an obstacle.

It can be enabled for multicopter vehicles in [Position mode](../flight_modes/position_mc.md), and can use sensor data from an offboard companion computer, a rangefinder attached to the flight controller, or both (fused).

> **Warning** Collision prevention may not prevent a crash if your vehicle is moving too fast! This feature has only been tested (at time of writing) for a vehicle moving at 4 m/s.

## Overview

*Collision Prevention* is enabled/configured on PX4 by setting the parameter for minimum allowed distance ([MPC_COL_PREV_D](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#MPC_COL_PREV_D)).

The feature requires obstacle information from either an external system (sent using the MAVLink [OBSTACLE_DISTANCE](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#OBSTACLE_DISTANCE) message) or a [distance sensor](../sensor/rangefinders.md) connected to the flight controller.

> **Note** Multiple sensors can be used to get information about, and prevent collisions with, objects *around* the vehicle. If multiple sources supply data for the *same* orientation, the system uses the data that reports the smallest distance to an object.

The vehicle starts braking as soon as it detects an obstacle. The velocity setpoint towards the obstacle is reduced linearly such that it is set to zero at the point when the vehicle reaches the minimum allowed distance. If the vehicle approaches any closer (i.e. it overshoots or is pushed) negative thrust is applied to repel it from the obstacle.

Only the velocity components *towards* the obstacle are affected. RC inputs that cause the vehicle to move tangentially to the obstacle are still obeyed. So if a vehicle approaches an obstacle from an angle, the vehicle will slow until it reaches the minimum distance and then "slide" along the surface until it is no longer blocked.

The user is notified through *QGroundControl* while *Collision Prevention* is actively controlling velocity setpoints.

## PX4 (Software) Setup

Enabled collision prevention by [setting the following parameter](../advanced_config/parameters.md) in *QGroundControl*:

- [MPC_COL_PREV_D](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#MPC_COL_PREV_D) - Set the minimum allowed distance (the closest distance that the vehicle can approach the obstacle). Set negative to disable *collision prevention*.
    
    This should be tuned for both the *desired* minimal distance and likely speed of the vehicle.

If you are using a distance sensor attached to your flight controller for collision prevention, it will need to be [attached and configured](#rangefinder) as described in the next section. If you are using a companion computer to provide obstacle information see [companion setup](#companion).

## PX4 Distance Sensor {#rangefinder}

At time of writing PX4 allows you to use the [Lanbao PSK-CM8JL65-CC5](../sensor/cm8jl65_ir_distance_sensor.md) IR distance sensor for collision prevention "out of the box", with minimal additional configuration:

- First [attach and configure the sensor](../sensor/cm8jl65_ir_distance_sensor.md), and enable collision prevention (as described above, using `MPC_COL_PREV_D`).
- Set the sensor orientation using [SENS_CM8JL65_R_0](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#SENS_CM8JL65_R_0).

<!-- ROTATION_FORWARD_FACING - Does it matter what angles? - ie is collision prevention active in 3 D? -->

Other sensors may be enabled, but this requires modification of driver code to set the sensor orientation and field of view.

- Attach and configure the distance sensor on a particular port (see [sensor-specific docs](../sensor/rangefinders.md)) and enable collision prevention using `MPC_COL_PREV_D`.
- Modify the driver to set the orientation. This should be done by mimicking the `SENS_CM8JL65_R_0` parameter (though you might also hard-code the orientation in the sensor *module.yaml* file to something like `sf0x start -d ${SERIAL_DEV} -R 25` - where 25 is equivalent to `ROTATION_DOWNWARD_FACING`).
- Modify the driver to set the *field of view* in the distance sensor UORB topic (`distance_sensor_s.h_fov`).

> **Tip** You can see the required modifications from the [feature PR](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/pull/12179). Please contribute back your changes!

## Companion Setup {#companion}

If using a companion computer, it needs to supply a stream of [OBSTACLE_DISTANCE](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#OBSTACLE_DISTANCE) messages when an obstacle is detected.

The minimum rate at which messages *must* be sent depends on vehicle speed - at higher rates the vehicle will have a longer time to respond to detected obstacles.

> **Info** Initial testing of the system used a vehicle moving at 4 m/s with `OBSTACLE_DISTANCE` messages being emitted at 30Hz (the maximum rate supported by the vision system). The system may work well at significantly higher speeds and lower frequency distance updates.

The tested hardware/software platform is [Auterion IF750A](https://auterion.com/if750a/) reference multicopter running the *local_planner* avoidance software from the [PX4/avoidance](https://github.com/PX4/avoidance#obstacle-detection-and-avoidance) repo.

The hardware and software should be set up as described in the [PX4/avoidance](https://github.com/PX4/avoidance#obstacle-detection-and-avoidance) repo. In order to emit `OBSTACLE_DISTANCE` messages you must use the *rqt_reconfigure* tool and set the parameter `send_obstacles_fcu` to true.

## Gazebo Setup

*Collision Prevention* can also be tested using Gazebo. See [PX4/avoidance](https://github.com/PX4/avoidance#obstacle-detection-and-avoidance) for setup instructions.
