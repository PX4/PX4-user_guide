# Basic Assembly

A typical autopilot "minimal" system running PX4 consists of a flight controller connected to a power system, GPS, external compass (optional), radio control system (optional) and/or telemetry radio system (optional).

This section contains topics that explain how to assemble such a system for different [flight controllers](../flight_controller/README.md).

:::tip
Quickstart guides are only provided for a few controllers. Other controllers will have similar connections. Additional information may be available in [flight controllers](../flight_controller/README.md) pages or in manufacturer documentation. :::

* See [Peripherals](../peripherals/README.md) for information about connecting sensors and other peripherals (e.g. airspeed sensor for planes).
* See [Airframe Builds](../airframes/README.md) for complete assembly examples on different vehicle frames.
* See [Multicopter Racer Setup](../config_mc/racer_setup.md) for racer-specific assembly and configuration information.
