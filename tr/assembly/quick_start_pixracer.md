# Pixracer Wiring Quick Start

> **Warning** Under construction.

This quick start guide shows how to power the [Pixracer](../flight_controller/pixracer.md) flight controller and connect its most important peripherals.

### Radio/RemoteÂ Control

A remote control (RC) radio system is required if you want to *manually* control your vehicle (PX4 does not require a radio system for autonomous flight modes).

You will need to [select a compatible transmitter/receiver](../getting_started/rc_transmitter_receiver.md) and then *bind* them so that they communicate (read the instructions that come with your specific transmitter/receiver).

The instructions below show how to connect the different types of receivers:

- FrSky receivers connect via the port shown, and can use the provided I/O Connector.

- PPM-SUM and S.BUS receivers connect to the **RCIN** port.

- PPM and PWM receivers that have an *individual wire for each channel* must connect to the **RCIN** port *via a PPM encoder* [like this one](http://www.getfpv.com/radios/radio-accessories/holybro-ppm-encoder-module.html) (PPM-Sum receivers use a single signal wire for all channels).
