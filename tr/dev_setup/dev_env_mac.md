# MacOS Development Environment

The following instructions set up a PX4 development environment for macOS. This environment can be used to build PX4 for:
* Pixhawk and other NuttX-based hardware
* [jMAVSim Simulation](../simulation/jmavsim.md)
* [Gazebo Simulation](../simulation/gazebo.md)

:::details
Apple M1 Macbook users! If you have an Apple M1 Macbook, make sure to run the terminal as x86 by setting up an x86 terminal:
1. Locate the Terminal application within the Utilities folder (**Finder > Go menu > Utilities**)
2. Select *Terminal.app* and right-click on it, then choose **Duplicate**.
3. Rename the duplicated Terminal app, e.g. to *x86 Terminal*
4. Now select the renamed *x86 Terminal* app and right-click and choose **Get Info*
5. Check the box for **Open using Rosetta**, then close the window
6. Run the *x86 Terminal*` as usual, which will fully support the current PX4 toolchain
:::

:::tip
This setup is supported by the PX4 dev team. To build other targets you will need to use a [different OS](../dev_setup/dev_env.md#supported-targets) (or an [unsupported development environment](../advanced/dev_env_unsupported.md)).

## Homebrew Installation

The installation of Homebrew is quick and easy: [installation instructions](https://brew.sh).

## Enable more open files (Handle "LD: too many open files" error)

Create the `~/.zshenv` file or append it (by running `open ~/.zshenv` on the terminal) and add this line:
```sh
ulimit -S -n 2048
```

## Enforce Python Version

If not already existing, create the file `~/.zshrc` and add these lines:

```sh
# Point pip3 to MacOS system python 3 pip
alias pip3=/usr/bin/pip3
```

## Common Tools

After installing Homebrew, run these commands in your shell to install the common tools:

```sh
brew tap PX4/px4
brew install px4-dev
```
Install the required Python packages

```sh
# install required packages using pip3
python3 -m pip install --user pyserial empy toml numpy pandas jinja2 pyyaml pyros-genmsg packaging
# if this fails with a permissions error, your Python install is in a system path - use this command instead:
sudo -H python3 -m pip install --user pyserial empy toml numpy pandas jinja2 pyyaml pyros-genmsg packaging
```

## Gazebo Simulation

To install SITL simulation with Gazebo:

```sh
brew install --cask xquartz
brew install px4-sim-gazebo
```

## jMAVSim Simulation

To use SITL simulation with jMAVSim you need to install a recent version of Java (e.g. Java 14). You can either download [Java 14 from Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk14-downloads.html) or use the AdoptOpenJDK tap:

```sh
brew tap AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk
brew install --cask adoptopenjdk14
```

```sh
brew install px4-sim-jmavsim
```

:::note
jMAVSim for PX4 v1.11 and earlier required Java 8.

## Next Steps

Once you have finished setting up the command-line toolchain:
- Install [VSCode](../dev_setup/vscode.md) (if you prefer using an IDE to the command line).
- Install the [QGroundControl Daily Build](https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/en/releases/daily_builds.html) :::tip The *daily build* includes development tools that hidden in release builds. It may also provide access to new PX4 features that are not yet supported in release builds.

- Continue to the [build instructions](../dev_setup/building_px4.md).
