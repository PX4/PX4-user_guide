# Airspeed Sensors

Airspeed sensors are *highly recommended* for fixed-wing and VTOL frames. They are so important because the autopilot does not have other means to detect stall. For fixed-wing flight it is the airspeed that guarantees lift not ground speed!

## Hardware Options

Recommended digital airspeed sensors include:

* MEAS Spec series (e.g. [MS4525DO](https://www.te.com/usa-en/product-CAT-BLPS0002.html), [MS5525](https://www.te.com/usa-en/product-CAT-BLPS0003.html)) 
  * [mRo I2C Airspeed Sensor JST-GH MS4525DO](https://store.mrobotics.io/mRo-I2C-Airspeed-Sensor-JST-GH-p/m10030a.htm) (mRo store)
  * [Digital Differential Airspeed Sensor Kit](https://store-drotek.com/793-digital-differential-airspeed-sensor-kit-.html) (Drotek).
* [EagleTree Airspeed MicroSensor V3](http://www.eagletreesystems.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=63) (eagletreesystems)
* [Sensirion SDP3X Differential Pressure Sensor](https://www.sensirion.com/en/flow-sensors/differential-pressure-sensors/worlds-smallest-differential-pressure-sensor/)
* [Holybro Digital Air Speed Sensor](https://shop.holybro.com/digital-air-speed-sensor_p1029.html)

All the above sensors are connected via the I2C bus/port.

:::note
Additionally, the [Avionics Anonymous Air Data Computer](https://www.tindie.com/products/avionicsanonymous/uavcan-air-data-computer-airspeed-sensor/) can be connected to the UAVCAN bus to determine not only high-accuracy airspeed, but also true static pressure and air temperature via onboard barometer and an OAT probe.

## Configuration

### Enable Airspeed Sensors

Unlike most other sensor drivers, the airspeed sensor drivers are not automatically started.

Enable each type using its [corresponding parameter](../advanced_config/parameters.md):

* Sensirion SDP3X ([SENS_EN_SDP3X](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#SENS_EN_SDP3X))
* TE MS4525 ([SENS_EN_MS4525](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#SENS_EN_MS4525))
* TE MS5525 ([SENS_EN_MS5525](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#SENS_EN_MS5525))
* Eagle Tree airspeed sensor ([SENS_EN_ETSASPD](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#SENS_EN_ETSASPD))

### Calibration

Airspeed calibration information can be found in: [Basic Configuration > Airspeed](../config/airspeed.md).
