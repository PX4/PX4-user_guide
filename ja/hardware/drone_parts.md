# Hardware (Drones & Drone Parts)

This section contains information about complete pre-built PX4 vehicles, and components that you can use if building your own drones:

* [Complete Vehicles](../complete_vehicles/README.md) - Complete Ready to Fly (RTF) or near-RTF vehicles (i.e. may require battery, RC controller)
* [Flight Controllers (Autopilots)](../flight_controller/README.md) - Autopilot hardware options (inluding [Pixhawk Series](../flight_controller/pixhawk_series.md))
* [Flight Controller Peripherals](../peripherals/README.md) - Components that can be attached to the flight controller (GPS, compass, motors, rangefinders, etc.). The device pages also explain how to configure the components to work with PX4.
* [Companion Computer Peripherals](../peripherals/companion_computer_peripherals.md) - Components that can be attached to an (optional) Companion Computer.
