# Airframe Setup

After installing firmware you need to configure the firmware parameters for your [specific airframe](../airframes/airframe_reference.md).

## Set the Airframe

To set the airframe:

1. Start *QGroundControl* and connect the vehicle.
2. Select the **Gear** icon (Vehicle Setup) in the top toolbar and then **Airframe** in the sidebar. 
3. Select the broad vehicle group/type that matches your airframe and then use the dropdown within the group to choose the airframe that best matches your vehicle.

    The example above shows *3DR Iris Quadrotor* selected from the *Quadrotor Wide* group.

4. Click **Apply and Restart**. Click **Apply** in the following prompt to save the settings and restart the vehicle.
