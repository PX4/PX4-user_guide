# PX4FLOW Smart Camera (Deprecated)

PX4 does not support the PX4Flow [optical flow](../sensor/optical_flow.md) sensor from PX4 v1.13.

Documentation has been removed (if needed, see [Legacy Docs for PX4Flow in v1.13](https://docs.px4.io/v1.13/en/sensor/px4flow.html)).

:::note
PX4 v1.13 does not work with current PX4FLow firmware.
PX4 may work with older PX4Flow firmware.
