# Tune Meanings (Pixhawk Series)

[Pixhawk-series flight controllers](../flight_controller/pixhawk_series.md) use audible tones/tunes and [LEDs](../getting_started/led_meanings.md) to indicate vehicle state and events (e.g. arming success and failure, low battery warnings).

The set of standard sounds are listed below.

> **Note** **Developers:** Tunes are defined in [/lib/tunes/tune_definition.desc](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/src/lib/tunes/tune_definition.desc) and can be tested using the [tune_control](https://dev.px4.io/master/en/middleware/modules_system.html#tunecontrol) module.

## Boot/Startup

These tunes are played during the boot sequence. <!-- https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/ROMFS/px4fmu_common/init.d/rcS -->
