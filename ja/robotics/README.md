# Robotics

Robotics APIs allow you to control PX4 from outside the flight stack computing environment (flight controller) using a [companion computer](../companion_computer/pixhawk_companion.md) or other computing environment. The APIs communicate with PX4 using [MAVLink](../middleware/mavlink.md) or [RTPS](../middleware/micrortps.md).

PX4 can be used with robotics APIs including [MAVSDK](https://mavsdk.mavlink.io/) and [ROS](../ros/README.md). [DroneKit](../robotics/dronekit.md) can also be used, but is not optimised for use with PX4.
