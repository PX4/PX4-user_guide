# Development Environment on Linux

Linux allows you to build for [all PX4 targets](../dev_setup/dev_env.md#supported-targets) (NuttX based hardware, Qualcomm Snapdragon Flight hardware, Linux-based hardware, Simulation, ROS).

:::tip
[Ubuntu Linux LTS](../dev_setup/dev_env_linux_ubuntu.md) LTS 18.04 and 20.04 are supported. Other Linux environments and versions may be made to work, but are less well tested and documented.

The following instructions explain how to set up a development environment on various Linux platforms.

* [Ubuntu/Debian Linux](../dev_setup/dev_env_linux_ubuntu.md) - Recommended!
* [CentOS Linux](../dev_setup/dev_env_linux_centos.md)
* [Arch Linux](../dev_setup/dev_env_linux_arch.md)
* [Advanced Linux](../dev_setup/dev_env_advanced_linux.md)


After setting up the build/simulation toolchain:
- [Additional Tools](../dev_setup/generic_dev_tools.md) lists some other useful tools.
- [Build instructions](../dev_setup/building_px4.md) explains how to download and build PX4 source code.
