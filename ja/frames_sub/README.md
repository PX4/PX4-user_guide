# Underwater Vehicles (UUV)

:::warning
Support for UUVs is _experimental_. The platform does not support all features needed in a product-quality UUV, and the platform is not regularly tested by the core development team.

At time of writing it has only been tested using ROS in offboard mode. The following features have not been implemented:
- Modes like missions, depth hold, stabilised manual control, etc.
- BlueRobotics gripper support.
:::

PX4 enables a number of unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) frames:
- [BlueROV2](../frames_sub/bluerov2.md): Vectored 6 DOF UUV
- HippoCampus UUV: [Airframe Reference](../airframes/airframe_reference.md#underwater-robot-2), [Gazebo Simulation](../simulation/gazebo_vehicles.md#hippocampus-tuhh-uuv)

:::note
Other UUVs may be listed in [Airframe Reference > Underwater Robots](../airframes/airframe_reference.md#underwater-robot-2).
