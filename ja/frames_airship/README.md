# Airships

:::warning

Support for airships is [experimental](../airframes/README.md#experimental-vehicles).

- Does not have a maintainer.
- Not regularly tested by the core development team.
- Limited support for different types of vehicles.

Maintainer volunteers, [contribution](../contribute/README.md) of new features, new frame configurations, or other improvements would all be very welcome!
:::


PX4 supports a single airship geometry with starboard, port and tail thrusters, and a thrust tilt server. The frame configuration is shown in [Airframes Reference > Airship](../airframes/airframe_reference.md#airship).
