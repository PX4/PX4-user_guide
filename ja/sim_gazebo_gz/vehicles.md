# Gazebo Vehicles

This topic lists/displays the vehicles supported by the PX4 [Gazebo](../sim_gazebo_gz/index.md) simulation, and the `make` commands required to run them (the commands are run from a terminal in the **PX4-Autopilot** directory).

The models are included in PX4 as a submodule that is fetched from the [Gazebo Models Repository](../sim_gazebo_gz/gazebo_models.md).

Supported vehicle types include: mutirotor, VTOL, Plane.

:::warning
See [Gazebo Classic Vehicles](../sim_gazebo_classic/vehicles.md) for vehicles that work with the older [Gazebo "Classic" simulation](../sim_gazebo_classic/index.md). Note that vehicle models are not interchangable between the two versions of the simulator: the vehicles on this page only work with (new) [Gazebo](../sim_gazebo_gz/index.md).

## Multicopter

### X500 Quadrotor

```sh
make px4_sitl gz_x500
```

### X500 Quadrotor with Visual Odometry

```sh
make px4_sitl gz_x500_vision
```

### X500 Quadrotor with Depth Camera

These models have a depth camera attached, modelled on the OAK-D.

_Forward-facing depth camera:_

```sh
make px4_sitl gz_x500_depth
```

### X500 Quadrotor with Monocular Camera

This models has a simple monocular camera sensor attached (there is no physical camera visualization on the model itself).

```sh
make px4_sitl gz_x500_mono_cam
```

::: info
The camera cannot yet be used to stream video or for image capture in QGroundControl. [PX4-Autopilot#22563](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/22563) can be used to track the additional work needed to fully enable these use cases.

## Plane/Fixed-wing

### Standard Plane

```sh
make px4_sitl gz_rc_cessna
```

### Advanced Plane

<Badge type="tip" text="PX4 v1.15" />

```sh
make px4_sitl gz_advanced_plane
```

![Advanced Plane in Gazebo](../../assets/simulation/gazebo/vehicles/advanced_plane.png)

::: info
The difference between the Advanced Plane and the "regular plane" lies in the Lift Physics that the two models use:

- You can configure the _Advanced Lift Drag_ plugin used by the model to more closely match a particular vehicle using the [Advanced Lift Drag Tool](../sim_gazebo_gz/tools_avl_automation.md).
- For more detail on the lift calculations for the Advanced Plane, see [PX4-SITL_gazebo-classic/src/liftdrag_plugin/index.md](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-SITL_gazebo-classic/blob/20ded0757b4f2cb362833538716caf1e938b162a/src/liftdrag_plugin/index.md)

## VTOL

### Standard VTOL

```sh
make px4_sitl gz_standard_vtol
```
