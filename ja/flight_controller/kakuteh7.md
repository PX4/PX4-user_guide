# Holybro Kakute H7

:::warning PX4 does not manufacture this (or any) autopilot. Contact the [manufacturer](https://shop.holybro.com/) for hardware support or compliance issues.
:::

The [Holybro Kakute H7](https://shop.holybro.com/kakute-h7-flight-controller-with-bluetooth_p1289.html) is full of features including dual plug-and-play 4in1 ESC ports, HD camera plug, barometer, OSD, 6x UARTs, full Blackbox MicroSD card slot, 5V and 9V BEC, easy soldering layout, and much more.

The Kakute H7 builds upon the best features of its predecessor, the [Kakute F7](../flight_controller/kakutef7.md), and further improves on hardware components and layout. Dual plug'n'play 4-in-1 ESC connectors simplify support for x8 and Octocopter configurations, keeping assembly simple and clean.

The board also has an on-board barometer, LED & buzzer pad, and I2C pad (SDA & SCL) for external GPS/Magnetometers.

## PX4 Bootloader Update

The board comes pre-installed with [Betaflight](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/wiki). Before PX4 firmware can be installed, the *PX4 bootloader* must be flashed. Download the [kakuteh7_bl.hex](https://github.com/PX4/px4_user_guide/raw/master/assets/flight_controller/kakuteh7/holybro_kakuteh7_bootloader.hex) bootloader binary and read [this page](../advanced_config/bootloader_update_from_betaflight.md) for flashing instructions.

## Building Firmware

To [build PX4](../dev_setup/building_px4.md) for this target:
```
make holybro_kakuteh7_default
```

## Installing PX4 Firmware

The firmware can be installed in any of the normal ways:
- Build and upload the source
  ```
  make holybro_kakuteh7_default upload
  ```
- [Load the firmware](../config/firmware.md) using *QGroundControl*. You can use either pre-built firmware or your own custom firmware.

:::note
KakuteH7 is supported with PX4 master & PX4 v1.13 or newer. If you are loading the pre-built firmware via QGroundcontrol, you must use QGC Daily or QGC verision newer than 4.1.7.
:::

## PX4 Configuration

In addition to the [basic configuration](../config/README.md), the following parameters are important:

| Parameter                                                              | Setting                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [SYS_HAS_MAG](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#SYS_HAS_MAG) | This should be disabled since the board does not have an internal mag. You can enable it if you attach an external mag. |
| [MOT_ORDERING](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#MOT_ORDERING) | If you use a 4-in-1 ESC with Betaflight motor assignment, this parameter can be set accordingly.                        |


## Serial Port Mapping

| UART   | Device     | Port                  |
| ------ | ---------- | --------------------- |
| USART1 | /dev/ttyS0 | TELEM1                |
| USART3 | /dev/ttyS2 | Debug Console         |
| UART4  | /dev/ttyS3 | GPS1                  |
| USART6 | /dev/ttyS4 | RC SBUS               |
| UART7  | /dev/ttyS5 | ESC telemetry (DShot) |


## Debug Port

### System Console

UART3 RX and TX are configured for use as the [System Console](../debug/system_console.md).

### SWD

The  [SWD interface](../debug/swd_debug.md) (JTAG) pins are:
- `SWCLK`: Test Point 2 (Pin 72 on the CPU)
- `SWDIO`: Test Point 3 (Pin 76 on CPU)
- `GND`: As marked on board
- `VDD_3V3`: As marked on board

These are shown below.
