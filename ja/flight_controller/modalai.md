# ModalAI

ModalAI has a standalone flight controller for PX4:

* [Flight Core v1](../flight_controller/modalai_fc_v1.md) - in a smaller Pixracer-style form factor, ready to be paired with [ModalAI VOXL](https://docs.modalai.com/voxl-datasheet/) for obstacle avoidance and GPS-denied navigation, or used independently as a standalone flight controller.

Coming Soon
* [VOXL Flight](../flight_controller/modalai_voxl_flight_v1.md)
