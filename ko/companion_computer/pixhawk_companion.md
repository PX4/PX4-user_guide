# 픽스호크 시리즈 보조 컴퓨터

PX4 can connect to companion computers (Raspberry Pi, Odroid, Tegra K1, etc.) using any configurable serial port, including the Ethernet port (if supported). Message are sent over the link using the [MAVLink](https://mavlink.io/en/) protocol.

## 픽스호크 설정

PX4 is configured by default to connect to a companion computer connected to the `TELEM 2` serial port. No additional PX4-side configuration should be required if you use this port

To enable MAVLink to connect on another port see [MAVLink Peripherals (GCS/OSD/Companion)](../peripherals/mavlink_peripherals.md) and [Serial Port Configuration](../peripherals/serial_configuration.md).

## 보조 컴퓨터 설정

In order to receive MAVLink, the companion computer needs to run some software talking to the serial port. The most common options are:

  * [MAVROS](../ros/mavros_installation.md) to communicate to ROS nodes
  * [C/C++ example code](https://github.com/mavlink/c_uart_interface_example) to connect custom code
  * [MAVLink Router](https://github.com/intel/mavlink-router) (recommended) or [MAVProxy](https://ardupilot.org/mavproxy/) to route MAVLink between serial and UDP


### Serial Port Hardware Setup

If you're connecting using a serial port, wire the port according to the instructions below. All Pixhawk serial ports operate at 3.3V and are 5V level compatible.

:::warning
Many modern companion computers only support 1.8V levels on their hardware UART and can be damaged by 3.3V levels. Use a level shifter. In most cases the accessible hardware serial ports already have some function (modem or console) associated with them and need to be *reconfigured in Linux* before they can be used.
:::

The safe bet is to use an FTDI Chip USB-to-serial adapter board and the wiring below. This always works and is easy to set up.

| TELEM2 |           | FTDI | &nbsp;            |
| ------ | --------- | ---- | ----------------- |
| 1      | +5V (red) |      | 연결 금지!            |
| 2      | TX  (출력)  | 5    | FTDI RX (황) (입력)  |
| 3      | RX  (입력)  | 4    | FTDI TX (적황) (출력) |
| 4      | CTS (입력)  | 6    | FTDI RTS (녹) (출력) |
| 5      | RTS (출력)  | 2    | FTDI CTS (갈) (입력) |
| 6      | GND       | 1    | FTDI GND (흑)      |

### Serial Port Software setup on Linux

On Linux the default name of a USB FTDI would be like `\dev\ttyUSB0`. If you have a second FTDI linked on the USB or an Arduino, it will registered as `\dev\ttyUSB1`. To avoid the confusion between the first plugged and the second plugged, we recommend you to create a symlink from `ttyUSBx` to a friendly name, depending on the Vendor and Product ID of the USB device.

Using `lsusb` we can get the vendor and product IDs.

```sh
$ lsusb

```

The Arduino is `Bus 003 Device 004: ID 2341:0042 Arduino SA Mega 2560 R3 (CDC ACM)`

The Pixhawk is `Bus 003 Device 005: ID 26ac:0011`

:::note
If you do not find your device, unplug it, execute `lsusb`, plug it, execute `lsusb` again and see the added device.
:::

Therefore, we can create a new UDEV rule in a file called `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-pixhawk.rules` with the following content, changing the idVendor and idProduct to yours.

```sh
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2341", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0042", SYMLINK+="ttyArduino"
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="26ac", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0011", SYMLINK+="ttyPixhawk"
```

Finally, after a **reboot** you can be sure to know which device is what and put `/dev/ttyPixhawk` instead of `/dev/ttyUSB0` in your scripts.

:::note
Be sure to add yourself in the `tty` and `dialout` groups via `usermod` to avoid to have to execute scripts as root.
:::

```sh
usermod -a -G tty ros-user
usermod -a -G dialout ros-user
newgrp ros-user
```
