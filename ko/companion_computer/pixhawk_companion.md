# Companion Computer for Pixhawk Series

Interfacing a companion computer (Raspberry Pi, Odroid, Tegra K1) to Pixhawk-family boards always works the same way: They are interfaced using a serial port to `TELEM 2`, the port intended for this purpose. The message format on this link is [MAVLink](https://mavlink.io/en/).

## Pixhawk Setup

Enable MAVLink on any [configurable serial port](https://docs.px4.io/en/peripherals/serial_configuration.html).

> **Tip** Typically the `TELEM 2` port is used for a companion computer.

To set up the default companion computer message stream on `TELEM 2`, set the following parameters:
* [MAV_1_CONFIG](../advanced/parameter_reference.md#MAV_1_CONFIG) = `TELEM 2` (`MAV_1_CONFIG` is often used to map the `TELEM 2` port)
* [MAV_1_MODE](../advanced/parameter_reference.md#MAV_1_MODE) = `Onboard`
* [SER_TEL2_BAUD](../advanced/parameter_reference.md#SER_TEL2_BAUD) = `921600` (921600 or higher recommended for applications like log streaming or FastRTPS)

For more information see [MAVLink Peripherals (GCS/OSD/Companion)](https://docs.px4.io/en/peripherals/mavlink_peripherals.html).


## Companion Computer Setup

In order to receive MAVLink, the companion computer needs to run some software talking to the serial port. The most common options are:

  * [MAVROS](../ros/mavros_installation.md) to communicate to ROS nodes
  * [C/C++ example code](https://github.com/mavlink/c_uart_interface_example) to connect custom code
  * [MAVLink Router](https://github.com/intel/mavlink-router) (recommended) or [MAVProxy](http://mavproxy.org) to route MAVLink between serial and UDP

## Hardware setup

Wire the serial port according to the instructions below. All Pixhawk serial ports operate at 3.3V and are 5V level compatible.

> **Warning** Many modern companion computers only support 1.8V levels on their hardware UART and can be damaged by 3.3V levels. Use a level shifter. In most cases the accessible hardware serial ports already have some function (modem or console) associated with them and need to be *reconfigured in Linux* before they can be used.

The safe bet is to use an FTDI Chip USB-to-serial adapter board and the wiring below. This always works and is easy to set up.

|  | TELEM2 |           | FTDI |                        |
|  | ------ | --------- | ---- | ---------------------- |
|  | 1      | +5V (red) |      | DO NOT CONNECT!        |
|  | 2      | Tx  (out) | 5    | FTDI RX (yellow) (in)  |
|  | 3      | Rx  (in)  | 4    | FTDI TX (orange) (out) |
|  | 4      | CTS (in)  | 6    | FTDI RTS (green) (out) |
|  | 5      | RTS (out) | 2    | FTDI CTS (brown) (in)  |
|  | 6      | GND       | 1    | FTDI GND (black)       |

## Software setup on Linux

On Linux the default name of a USB FTDI would be like `\dev\ttyUSB0`. If you have a second FTDI linked on the USB or an Arduino, it will registered as `\dev\ttyUSB1`. To avoid the confusion between the first plugged and the second plugged, we recommend you to create a symlink from `ttyUSBx` to a friendly name, depending on the Vendor and Product ID of the USB device.

Using `lsusb` we can get the vendor and product IDs.

```sh
$ lsusb

```

The Arduino is `Bus 003 Device 004: ID 2341:0042 Arduino SA Mega 2560 R3 (CDC ACM)`

The Pixhawk is `Bus 003 Device 005: ID 26ac:0011`

> **Note** If you do not find your device, unplug it, execute `lsusb`, plug it, execute `lsusb` again and see the added device.

Therefore, we can create a new UDEV rule in a file called `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-pixhawk.rules` with the following content, changing the idVendor and idProduct to yours.

```sh
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2341", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0042", SYMLINK+="ttyArduino"
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="26ac", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0011", SYMLINK+="ttyPixhawk"
```

Finally, after a **reboot** you can be sure to know which device is what and put `/dev/ttyPixhawk` instead of `/dev/ttyUSB0` in your scripts.

> **Note** Be sure to add yourself in the `tty` and `dialout` groups via `usermod` to avoid to have to execute scripts as root.

```sh
usermod -a -G tty ros-user
usermod -a -G dialout ros-user
```
