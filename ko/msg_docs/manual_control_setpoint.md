# Any of the channels may not be available and be set to NaN
# to indicate that it does not contain valid data.
# The variable names follow the definition of the
# MANUAL_CONTROL mavlink message.
# The default range is from -1 to 1 (mavlink message -1000 to 1000)
# The range for the z variable is defined from 0 to 1. (The z field of
# the MANUAL_CONTROL mavlink message is defined from -1000 to 1000)

float32 x            # stick position in x direction -1..1
                 # in general corresponds to forward/back motion or pitch of vehicle,
