# Modules & Commands Reference
The following pages document the PX4 modules, drivers and commands. They describe the provided functionality, high-level implementation overview and how to use the command-line interface.

> **Note** **This is auto-generated from the source code** and contains the most recent modules documentation.

It is not a complete list and NuttX provides some additional commands as well (such as `free`). Use `help` on the console to get a list of all available commands, and in most cases `command help` will print the usage.

Since this is generated from source, errors must be reported/fixed in the [Firmware](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware) repository. The documentation pages can be generated by running the following command from the root of the Firmware directory:
```
make module_documentation
```
The generated files will be written to the `modules` directory.
