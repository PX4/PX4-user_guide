# Gazebo Vehicles

This topic lists/displays the vehicles supported by the PX4 [Gazebo](../sim_gazebo_gz/README.md) simulation, and the `make` commands required to run them (the commands are run from a terminal in the **PX4-Autopilot** directory).

Supported vehicle types include: mutirotor, VTOL, Plane.

:::note
The [Gazebo](../sim_gazebo_gz/README.md) page shows how to install Gazebo.

:::warning
See [Gazebo Classic Vehicles](../sim_gazebo_classic/vehicles.md) for vehicles that work with the older [Gazebo "Classic" simulation](../sim_gazebo_classic/README.md). Note that vehicle models are not interchangable between the two versions of the simulator: the vehicles on this page only work with (new) [Gazebo](../sim_gazebo_gz/README.md).

## Multicopter

### X500 Quadrotor

```sh
make px4_sitl gz_x500
```

### X500 Quadrotor with Visual Odometry

```sh
make px4_sitl gz_x500_vision
```

### X500 Quadrotor with Depth Camera

These models have a depth camera attached, modelled on the OAK-D.

_Forward-facing depth camera:_

```sh
make px4_sitl gz_x500_depth
```

## Plane/Fixed-wing

### Standard Plane

```sh
make px4_sitl gz_rc_cessna
```

### Advanced Plane

```sh
make px4_sitl gz_advanced_plane
```

:::note
The difference between the Advanced Plane and the "regular plane" lies in the Lift Physics that the two models use. For more detail on the lift calculations for the Advanced Plane, see: https://github.com/PX4/PX4-SITL_gazebo-classic/blob/20ded0757b4f2cb362833538716caf1e938b162a/src/liftdrag_plugin/README.md

## VTOL

### Standard VTOL

```sh
make px4_sitl gz_standard_vtol
```
