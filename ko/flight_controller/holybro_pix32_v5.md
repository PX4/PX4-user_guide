# Holybro Pix32 v5

> **Warning** PX4 does not manufacture this (or any) autopilot. Contact the [manufacturer](https://shop.holybro.com/) for hardware support or compliance issues.

[Pix32 v5](https://shop.holybro.com/pix32-v5_p1218.html)<sup>&reg;</sup> is an advanced autopilot flight controller designed and made by Holybro<sup>&reg;</sup>. It is optimized to run on PX4 firmware, which is intended for both academic and commercial developers. It is based on the [Pixhawk-project](https://pixhawk.org/) **FMUv5** open hardware design and runs PX4 on the [NuttX](http://nuttx.org) OS. It can be regarded as a variant version of Pixhawk4.

The Pix32 v5 is designed for pilots who need a high power, flexible and customisable flight control system. It is comprised of a separate flight controller and carrier (base) board, which are connected by a 100pin connector. This design allows users to either select a base board made by Holybro, or customize their own.

## Voltage Ratings

*Pix32 v5* can be triple-redundant on the power supply if three power sources are supplied. The three power rails are: **POWER1**, **POWER2** and **USB**.

> **Note** The output power rails **FMU PWM OUT** and **I/O PWM OUT** (0V to 36V) do not power the flight controller board (and are not powered by it). You must supply power to one of **POWER1**, **POWER2** or **USB** or the board will be unpowered.

**Normal Operation Maximum Ratings**

Under these conditions all power sources will be used in this order to power the system:
1. **POWER1** and **POWER2** inputs (4.9V to 5.5V)
1. **USB** input (4.75V to 5.25V)

**Absolute Maximum Ratings**

Under these conditions the system will not draw any power (will not be operational), but will remain intact.
1. **POWER1** and **POWER2** inputs (operational range 4.1V to 5.7V, 0V to 10V undamaged)
1. **USB** input (operational range 4.1V to 5.7V, 0V to 6V undamaged)
1. Servo input: VDD_SERVO pin of **FMU PWM OUT** and **I/O PWM OUT** (0V to 42V undamaged)

## Building Firmware

> **Tip** Most users will not need to build this firmware! It is pre-built and automatically installed by *QGroundControl* when appropriate hardware is connected.

To [build PX4](https://dev.px4.io/master/en/setup/building_px4.html) for this target:
```
make holybro_pix32v5_default
```

## Debug Port

The system's [serial console](https://dev.px4.io/master/en/debug/system_console.html) and SWD interface runs on the **FMU Debug** port

<!--while the I/O console and SWD interface can be accessed via **I/O Debug** port.-->

![FMU debug port diagram](../../assets/flight_controller/holybro_pix32_v5/FMU_Debug_Port_Horizontal.jpg)

The pinout uses the standard [Pixhawk debug connector pinout](https://pixhawk.org/pixhawk-connector-standard/#dronecode_debug). For wiring information see:
- [System Console > Pixhawk Debug Port](https://dev.px4.io/master/en/debug/system_console.html#pixhawk_debug_port) (PX4 Developer Guide)
