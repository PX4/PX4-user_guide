## Forums and Chat

The core development team and community are active on the following forums and chat channels.

* [PX4 Discuss](http://discuss.px4.io/) (*recommended*)
* [Slack](http://slack.px4.io) (sign up)

:::tip
Post on [PX4 Discuss](http://discuss.px4.io/) first! If you don't get a response in a few days then ping us on Slack with a link to your question (on discuss).

Discuss is better than slack in the first instance because questions and answers are permanent.

* Upload logs to [Flight Log Review](http://logs.px4.io/)

## Weekly Dev Call

:::tip
Developers are most welcome to attend the [weekly dev call](../contribute/dev_call.md) (and other [developer events](../README.md#calendar)) to engage more deeply with the project.
:::

The [Dev Call](../contribute/dev_call.md) is a weekly meeting attended by the PX4 dev team to discuss platform technical details, coordinate activities and perform in-depth analysis.

There is also space in the agenda to discuss pull requests, major impacting issues and Q&A.


## Tests Flights

The Dronecode test team can help review (test flight) your pull requests and provide feedback and logs.

See [Test Flights](../test_and_ci/test_flights.md) for information about available test vehicles/autopilots, how to request flights, and response times.
