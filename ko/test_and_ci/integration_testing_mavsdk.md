# MAVSDK 통합 시험

PX4는 [MAVSDK](https://mavsdk.mavlink.io)를 기반으로 종단간 통합 시험을 진행할 수 있습니다.

시험 절차는 이제부터 근본적으로 SITL을 대상으로 개발하며, 지속 통합 체계(CI)에서 실행합니다. 그러나, 실제 시험도 일반화할 수 있습니다.

시스템 영역(예: `/usr/lib` 또는 `/usr/local/lib`)에 MAVSDK C++ 라이브러리를 설치해야 시험을 진행할 수 있습니다.

## MAVSDK C++ 라이브러리 설치

### 모든 PX4 시험 절차 실행

바이너리를 그대로 설치하거나 소스코드를 컴파일하여 설치하십시오:
- Install the development toolchain for [Linux](../dev_setup/dev_env_linux_ubuntu.md) or [macOS](../dev_setup/dev_env_mac.md) (Windows not supported). Gazebo is required, and should be installed by default.
- [Get the PX4 source code](../dev_setup/building_px4.md#download-the-px4-source-code):

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot.git --recursive
  cd PX4-Autopilot
  ```


### Build PX4 for Testing

PX4 코드를 빌드하려면 다음 명령을 내리십시오:

```sh
DONT_RUN=1 make px4_sitl gazebo mavsdk_tests 
```

### Install the MAVSDK C++ Library

SITL 시험을 [sitl.json](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/master/test/mavsdk_tests/configs/sitl.json)에 지정한대로 실행하려면 다음 명령을 내리십시오:

모든 가능한 명령행 인자를 살펴보려면 다음 내용을 살펴보십시오:
- [MAVSDK > Installation > C++](https://mavsdk.mavlink.io/develop/en/getting_started/installation.html#cpp): Install as a prebuilt library on supported platforms (recommended)
- [MAVSDK > Contributing > Building from Source](https://mavsdk.mavlink.io/develop/en/contributing/build.html#build_sdk_cpp): Build  C++ library from source.

## PX4 코드 준비

활용 용어:

```sh
test/mavsdk_tests/mavsdk_test_runner.py test/mavsdk_tests/configs/sitl.json --speed-factor 10
```

This will list all of the tests and then run them sequentially.


To see all possible command line arguments use the `-h` argument:

```sh
test/mavsdk_tests/mavsdk_test_runner.py -h

usage: mavsdk_test_runner.py [-h] [--log-dir LOG_DIR] [--speed-factor SPEED_FACTOR] [--iterations ITERATIONS] [--abort-early] [--gui] [--model MODEL]
                             [--case CASE] [--debugger DEBUGGER] [--verbose]
                             config_file

positional arguments:
  config_file           JSON config file to use

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --log-dir LOG_DIR     Directory for log files
  --speed-factor SPEED_FACTOR
                        how fast to run the simulation
  --iterations ITERATIONS
                        how often to run all tests
  --abort-early         abort on first unsuccessful test
  --gui                 display the visualization for a simulation
  --model MODEL         only run tests for one model
  --case CASE           only run tests for one case
  --debugger DEBUGGER   choice from valgrind, callgrind, gdb, lldb
  --verbose             enable more verbose output
```

## 구현상 참고

Run a single test by specifying the `model` and test `case` as command line options. For example, to test flying a tailsitter in a mission you might run:

```bash
test/mavsdk_tests/mavsdk_test_runner.py test/mavsdk_tests/configs/sitl.json --speed-factor 10 --model tailsitter --case 'Fly square Multicopter Missions including RTL'
```

The easiest way to find out the current set of models and their associated test cases is to run all PX4 tests [as shown above](#run-all-px4-tests) (note, you can then cancel the build if you wish to test just one).

At time of writing the list generated by running all tests is:
```
About to run 39 test cases for 3 selected models (1 iteration):
  - iris:
    - 'Land on GPS lost during mission (baro height mode)'
    - 'Land on GPS lost during mission (GPS height mode)'
    - 'Continue on mag lost during mission'
    - 'Continue on baro lost during mission (baro height mode)'
    - 'Continue on baro lost during mission (GPS height mode)'
    - 'Continue on baro stuck during mission (baro height mode)'
    - 'Continue on baro stuck during mission (GPS height mode)'
    - 'Takeoff and Land'

## Notes on implementation

- The tests are invoked from the test runner script [mavsdk_test_runner.py](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/master/test/mavsdk_tests/mavsdk_test_runner.py), which is written in Python.

  In addition to MAVSDK, this runner starts `px4` as well as Gazebo for SITL tests, and collects the logs of these processes.
- The test runner is a C++ binary that contains:
  - The [main](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/master/test/mavsdk_tests/test_main.cpp) function to parse the arguments.
  - An abstraction around MAVSDK called [autopilot_tester](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/master/test/mavsdk_tests/autopilot_tester.h).
  - The actual tests using the abstraction around MAVSDK as e.g. [test_multicopter_mission.cpp](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/master/test/mavsdk_tests/test_multicopter_mission.cpp).
  - The tests use the [catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) unit testing framework. The reasons for using this framework are:
      - Asserts (`REQUIRE`) which are needed to abort a test can be inside of functions (and not just in the top level test as is [the case with gtest](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/docs/advanced.md#assertion-placement)).
      - Dependency management is easier because *catch2* can just be included as a header-only library.
      - *Catch2* supports [tags](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/master/docs/test-cases-and-sections.md#tags), which allows for flexible composition of tests.


Terms used:
- "model": This is the selected Gazebo model, e.g. `iris`.
- "test case": This is a [catch2 test case](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/master/docs/test-cases-and-sections.md).
