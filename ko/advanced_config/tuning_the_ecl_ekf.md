# Using the ecl EKF

이 튜토리얼은 ECL EKF 알고리즘 사용에 대한 일반적인 질문에 답변합니다.

> **팁** *PX4 Developer Summit 2019*에서 Paul Riseborough 박사가 발표한 [PX4 State Estimation Overview](https://youtu.be/HkYRJJoyBwQ)는 추정기의 개요와 2018/2019년도의 주요 변화와 2020년도 까지의 예상 개선점에 대해 설명합니다. 

## What is the ecl EKF?

Estimation and Control Library (ECL)은 센서 측정값을 처리하고, 아래와 같은 상태를 추정하기 위해 확장 칼만 필터 (EKF) 알고리즘을 사용합니다:

* Quaternion defining the rotation from North, East, Down local earth frame to X,Y,Z body frame
* Velocity at the IMU - North,East,Down \(m/s\)
* Position at the IMU - North,East,Down \(m\)
* IMU delta angle bias estimates - X,Y,Z \(rad\)
* IMU delta velocity bias estimates - X,Y,Z\(m/s\)
* Earth Magnetic field components - North,East,Down \(gauss\)
* Vehicle body frame magnetic field bias - X,Y,Z \(gauss\)
* Wind velocity - North,East \(m/s\)

IMU와 다른 센서들이 동기화되지 않아 서로 다른 측정 시간을 갖는 것을 허용하기 위해, EKF는 지연된 '합성 시간축'에서 실행됩니다. 각 센서 데이터는 선입선출(FIFO) 버퍼에 저장되고 알맞은 시간에 사용되기 위해 EKF에 의해 출력됩니다. The delay compensation for each sensor is controlled by the [EKF2_*_DELAY](../advanced/parameter_reference.md#ekf2) parameters.

보완 필터는 버퍼링된 IMU 데이터를 사용하여 상태를 '합성 시간축'에서 현재 시간으로 전파하는 데 사용됩니다. The time constant for this filter is controlled by the [EKF2_TAU_VEL](../advanced/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_TAU_VEL) and [EKF2_TAU_POS](../advanced/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_TAU_POS) parameters.

> **Note** The 'fusion time horizon' delay and length of the buffers is determined by the largest of the EKF2\_\*\_DELAY parameters. 만약 센서가 사용되지 않는다면, 해당 센서의 시간 지연 매개변수를 0으로 맞추는 것을 권장합니다. "합성 시간축"의 지연을 줄이면 상태를 현재 시간으로 전달하는 데 사용되는 보완 필터의 오차가 줄어듭니다.

위치 및 속도 상태는 제어 루프로 출력되기 전에 IMU와 차체 프레임 사이의 오프셋을 고려하여 조정됩니다. The position of the IMU relative to the body frame is set by the `EKF2\_IMU\_POS\_X,Y,Z` parameters.

EKF는 IMU 데이터를 상태 예측에만 사용합니다. IMU 데이터는 EKF 유도 과정에서 관측값으로 사용되지 않습니다. 공분산 예측, 상태 업데이트 및 공분산 행렬 업데이트에 사용되는 대수적 계산식은 Matlab symbolic toolbox를 사용하여 유도되었습니다. 계산식은 다음 링크에서 찾을 수 있습니다:[Matlab Symbolic Derivation](https://github.com/PX4/ecl/blob/master/EKF/matlab/scripts/Inertial Nav EKF/GenerateNavFilterEquations.m).

## EKF는 어떤 센서 측정값을 사용하나요?

The EKF has different modes of operation that allow for different combinations of sensor measurements. On start-up the filter checks for a minimum viable combination of sensors and after initial tilt, yaw and height alignment is completed, enters a mode that provides rotation, vertical velocity, vertical position, IMU delta angle bias and IMU delta velocity bias estimates.

This mode requires IMU data, a source of yaw \(magnetometer or external vision\) and a source of height data. This minimum data set is required for all EKF modes of operation. Other sensor data can then be used to estimate additional states.

### IMU

* Three axis body fixed Inertial Measurement unit delta angle and delta velocity data at a minimum rate of 100Hz. Note: Coning corrections should be applied to the IMU delta angle data before it is used by the EKF.

### Magnetometer

Three axis body fixed magnetometer data \(or external vision system pose data\) at a minimum rate of 5Hz is required. Magnetometer data can be used in two ways:

* Magnetometer measurements are converted to a yaw angle using the tilt estimate and magnetic declination. This yaw angle is then used as an observation by the EKF. This method is less accurate and does not allow for learning of body frame field offsets, however it is more robust to magnetic anomalies and large start-up gyro biases. It is the default method used during start-up and on ground.
* The XYZ magnetometer readings are used as separate observations. This method is more accurate and allows body frame offsets to be learned, but assumes the earth magnetic field environment only changes slowly and performs less well when there are significant external magnetic anomalies.

The logic used to select the mode is set by the [EKF2_MAG_TYPE](../advanced/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_MAG_TYPE) parameter.

The option is available to operate without a magnetometer, either by replacing it using [yaw from a dual antenna GPS](#yaw_measurements) or using the IMU measurements and GPS velocity data to [estimate yaw from vehicle movement](#yaw_from_gps_velocity).

### Height

A source of height data - either GPS, barometric pressure, range finder or external vision at a minimum rate of 5Hz is required.

> GPS height can be used directly by the EKF via setting of the [EKF2_HGT_MODE](../advanced/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_HGT_MODE) parameter.

If these measurements are not present, the EKF will not start. When these measurements have been detected, the EKF will initialise the states and complete the tilt and yaw alignment. When tilt and yaw alignment is complete, the EKF can then transition to other modes of operation enabling use of additional sensor data:

#### Correction for Static Pressure Position Error

Barometric pressure altitude is subject to errors generated by aerodynamic disturbances caused by vehicle wind relative velocity and orientation. This is known in aeronautics as *static pressure position error*. The EKF2 module that uses the ECL/EKF2 estimator library provides a method of compensating for these errors, provided wind speed state estimation is active.

If operating over a flat surface that can be used as a zero height datum, the range finder data can also be used directly by the EKF to estimate height by setting the [EKF2_HGT_MODE](../advanced/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_HGT_MODE) parameter to 2.

For multi-rotors, fusion of [Drag Specific Forces](#mc_wind_estimation_using_drag) can be enabled and tuned to provide the required wind velocity state estimates.

The EKF2 module models the error as a body fixed ellipsoid that specifies the fraction of dynamic pressure that is added to/subtracted from the barometric pressure - before it is converted to a height estimate. See the following parameter documentation for information on how to use this feature:

* [EKF2_PCOEF_XP](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_PCOEF_XP)
* [EKF2_PCOEF_XN](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_PCOEF_XN)
* [EKF2_PCOEF_YP](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_PCOEF_YP)
* [EKF2_PCOEF_YN](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_PCOEF_YN)
* [EKF2_PCOEF_Z](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_PCOEF_Z)

### GPS

#### Position and Velocity Measurements

GPS measurements will be used for position and velocity if the following conditions are met:

* GPS use is enabled via setting of the [EKF2_AID_MASK](../advanced/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_AID_MASK) parameter.
* GPS quality checks have passed. These checks are controlled by the [EKF2_GPS_CHECK](../advanced/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_GPS_CHECK) and `EKF2\_REQ\_\*` parameters.
* The quality metric returned by the flow sensor is greater than the minimum requirement set by the [EKF2_OF_QMIN](../advanced/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_OF_QMIN) parameter.

#### Yaw Measurements

Some GPS receivers such as the [Trimble MB-Two RTK GPS receiver](https://www.trimble.com/Precision-GNSS/MB-Two-Board.aspx) can be used to provide a heading measurement that replaces the use of magnetometer data. This can be a significant advantage when operating in an environment where large magnetic anomalies are present, or at latitudes here the earth's magnetic field has a high inclination. Use of GPS yaw measurements is enabled by setting bit position 7 to 1 (adding 128) in the [EKF2_AID_MASK](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_AID_MASK) parameter.

<span id="yaw_from_gps_velocity"></span>

#### Yaw From GPS Velocity

The EKF runs an additional multi-hypothesis filter internally that uses multiple 3-state Extended Kalman Filters (EKF's) whose states are NE velocity and yaw angle. These individual yaw angle estimates are then combined using a Gaussian Sum Filter (GSF). The individual 3-state EKF's use IMU and GPS horizontal velocity data (plus optional airspeed data) and do not rely on any prior knowledge of the yaw angle or magnetometer measurements. This provides a backup to the yaw from the main filter and is used to reset the yaw for the main 24-state EKF when a post-takeoff loss of navigation indicates that the yaw estimate from the magnetometer is bad. This will result in an `Emergency yaw reset - magnetometer use stopped` message information message at the GCS.

Data from this estimator is logged when ekf2 replay logging is enabled and can be viewed in the `yaw_estimator_status` message. The individual yaw estimates from the individual 3-state EKF yaw estimators are in the `yaw` fields. The GSF combined yaw estimate is in the `yaw_composite` field. The variance for the GSF yaw estimate is in the `yaw_variance` field. All angles are in radians. Weightings applied by the GSF to the individual 3-state EKF outputs are in the`weight` fields.

This also makes it possible to operate without any magnetometer data or dual antenna GPS receiver for yaw provided some horizontal movement after takeoff can be performed to enable the yaw to become observable. To use this feature, set [EKF2_MAG_TYPE](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_MAG_TYPE) to `none` (5) to disable magnetometer use. Once the vehicle has performed sufficient horizontal movement to make the yaw observable, the main 24-state EKF will align it's yaw to the GSF estimate and commence use of GPS.

#### Dual Receivers

Data from GPS receivers can be blended using an algorithm that weights data based on reported accuracy (this works best if both receivers output data at the same rate and use the same accuracy). The mechanism also provides automatic failover if data from a receiver is lost (it allows, for example, a standard GPS to be used as a backup to a more accurate RTK receiver). This is controlled by the [EKF2_GPS_MASK](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_GPS_MASK) parameter.

The [EKF2_GPS_MASK](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_GPS_MASK) parameter is set by default to disable blending and always use the first receiver, so it will have to be set to select which receiver accuracy metrics are used to decide how much each receiver output contributes to the blended solution. Where different receiver models are used, it is important that the [EKF2_GPS_MASK](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_GPS_MASK) parameter is set to a value that uses accuracy metrics that are supported by both receivers. For example do not set bit position 0 to `true` unless the drivers for both receivers publish values in the `s_variance_m_s` field of the `vehicle_gps_position` message that are comparable. This can be difficult with receivers from different manufacturers due to the different way that accuracy is defined, e.g. CEP vs 1-sigma, etc.

The following items should be checked during setup:

* Verify that data for the second receiver is present. This will be logged as `vehicle_gps_position_1` and can also be checked when connected via the *nsh console* using the command `listener vehicle_gps_position -i 1`. The [GPS_2_CONFIG](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#GPS_2_CONFIG) parameter will need to be set correctly.
* Check the `s_variance_m_s`, `eph` and `epv` data from each receiver and decide which accuracy metrics can be used. If both receivers output sensible `s_variance_m_s` and `eph` data, and GPS vertical position is not being used directly for navigation, then setting [EKF2_GPS_MASK](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_GPS_MASK) to 3 is recommended. Where only `eph` data is available and both receivers do not output `s_variance_m_s` data, set [EKF2_GPS_MASK](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_GPS_MASK) to 2. Bit position 2 would only be set if the GPS had been selected as a primary height source with the [EKF2_HGT_MODE](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_HGT_MODE) parameter and both receivers output sensible `epv` data.
* External vision system pose data will be used for yaw estimation if bit position 4 in the [EKF2_AID_MASK](../advanced/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_AID_MASK) parameter is true.
* Where receivers output at different rates, the blended output will be at the rate of slower receiver. Where possible receivers should be configured to output at the same rate.

#### GPS Performance Requirements

For the ECL to accept GPS data for navigation, certain minimum requirements need to be satisfied over a period of 10 seconds (minimums are defined in the [EKF2_REQ_*](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_REQ_EPH) parameters)

The table below shows the different metrics directly reported or calculated from the GPS data, and the minimum required values for the data to be used by ECL. In addition, the *Average Value* column shows typical values that might reasonably be obtained from a standard GNSS module (e.g. uBlox M8 series) - i.e. values that are considered good/acceptable.

> **Note** The `hpos_drift_rate`, `vpos_drift_rate` and `hspd` are calculated over a period of 10 seconds and published in the `ekf2_gps_drift` topic. Note that `ekf2_gps_drift` is not logged!

### Range Finder

Range finder distance to ground is used by a single state filter to estimate the vertical position of the terrain relative to the height datum.

If operating over a flat surface that can be used as a zero height datum, the range finder data can also be used directly by the EKF to estimate height by setting the [EKF2_HGT_MODE](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_HGT_MODE) parameter to 2.

### Airspeed

Equivalent Airspeed \(EAS\) data can be used to estimate wind velocity and reduce drift when GPS is lost by setting [EKF2_ARSP_THR](../advanced/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_ARSP_THR) to a positive value. Airspeed data will be used when it exceeds the threshold set by a positive value for [EKF2_ARSP_THR](../advanced/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_ARSP_THR) and the vehicle type is not rotary wing.

### Synthetic Sideslip

Fixed wing platforms can take advantage of an assumed sideslip observation of zero to improve wind speed estimation and also enable wind speed estimation without an airspeed sensor. This is enabled by setting the [EKF2_FUSE_BETA](../advanced/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_FUSE_BETA) parameter to 1.

<span id="mc_wind_estimation_using_drag"></span>

### Drag Specific Forces

Multi-rotor platforms can take advantage of the relationship between airspeed and drag force along the X and Y body axes to estimate North/East components of wind velocity. This is enabled by setting bit position 5 in the [EKF2_AID_MASK](../advanced/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_AID_MASK) parameter to true. The relationship between airspeed and specific force \(IMU acceleration\) along the X and Y body axes is controlled by the [EKF2_BCOEF_X](../advanced/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_BCOEF_X) and [EKF2_BCOEF_Y](../advanced/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_BCOEF_Y) parameters which set the ballistic coefficients for flight in the X and Y directions respectively. The amount of specific force observation noise is set by the [EKF2_DRAG_NOISE](../advanced/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_DRAG_NOISE) parameter.

These can be tuned by flying the vehicle in [Position mode](../flight_modes/position_mc.md) repeatedly forwards/backwards between rest and maximum maximum speed, adjusting [EKF2_BCOEF_X](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_BCOEF_X) so that the corresponding innovation sequence in the `ekf2_innovations_0.drag_innov[0]` log message is minimised. This is then repeated for right/left movement with adjustment of [EKF2_BCOEF_Y](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_BCOEF_Y) to minimise the `ekf2_innovations_0.drag_innov[1]` innovation sequence. Tuning is easier if this testing is conducted in still conditions.

If you are able to log data without dropouts from boot using [SDLOG_MODE = 1](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#SDLOG_MODE) and [SDLOG_PROFILE = 2](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#SDLOG_PROFILE), have access to the development environment, and are able to build code, then we recommended you fly *once* and perform the tuning on logs generated via [EKF2 Replay](https://dev.px4.io/master/en/debug/system_wide_replay.html#ekf2-replay) of the flight data.

### Optical Flow

Optical flow data will be used if the following conditions are met:

* Valid range finder data is available.
* The ecl EKF uses more RAM and flash space
* The quality metric returned by the flow sensor is greater than the minimum requirement set by the [EKF2_OF_QMIN](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_OF_QMIN) parameter.

<span id="ekf2_extvis"></span>

### External Vision System

After re-tuning the filter, particularly re-tuning that involve reducing the noise variables, the value of estimator\_status.gps\_check\_fail\_flags should be checked to ensure that it remains zero.

* The ecl EKF is able to fuse data from sensors with different time delays and data rates in a mathematically consistent way which improves accuracy during dynamic manoeuvres once time delay parameters are set correctly.
* External vision system vertical position data will be used if the [EKF2_HGT_MODE](../advanced/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_HGT_MODE) parameter is set to 3.
* External vision system horizontal position data will be used if bit position 3 in the [EKF2_AID_MASK](../advanced/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_AID_MASK) parameter is true.
* External vision system orientation data will be used for yaw estimation if bit position 4 in the [EKF2_AID_MASK](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_AID_MASK) parameter is true.
* External vision reference frame offset will be estimated and used to rotate the external vision system data if bit position 6 in the [EKF2_AID_MASK](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_AID_MASK) parameter is true.

Either bit 4 (`EV_YAW`) or bit 6 (`EV_ROTATE`) should be set to true, but not both together. Following [EKF2_AID_MASK](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_AID_MASK) values are supported when using with an external vision system.

| EKF_AID_MASK value | Set bits                      | Description                                                    |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 321                  | GPS + EV_VEL + ROTATE_EV    | Heading w.r.t. North (**Recommended**)                         |
| 73                   | GPS + EV_POS + ROTATE_EV    | Heading w.r.t. North (*Not recommended*, use `EV_VEL` instead) |
| 24                   | EV_POS + EV_YAW             | Heading w.r.t. external vision frame                           |
| 72                   | EV_POS + ROTATE_EV          | Heading w.r.t. North                                           |
| 272                  | EV_VEL + EV_YAW             | Heading w.r.t. external vision frame                           |
| 320                  | EV_VEL + ROTATE_EV          | Heading w.r.t. North                                           |
| 280                  | EV_POS + EV_VEL + EV_YAW    | Heading w.r.t. external vision frame                           |
| 328                  | EV_POS + EV_VEL + ROTATE_EV | Heading w.r.t. North                                           |

The EKF considers uncertainty in the visual pose estimate. This uncertainty information can be sent via the covariance fields in the MAVLink [ODOMETRY](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#ODOMETRY) message or it can be set through the parameters [EKF2_EVP_NOISE](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_EVP_NOISE), [EKF2_EVV_NOISE](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_EVV_NOISE) and [EKF2_EVA_NOISE](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_EVA_NOISE). You can choose the source of the uncertainty with [EKF2_EV_NOISE_MD](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_EV_NOISE_MD).

## How do I use the 'ecl' library EKF?

Set the [SYS_MC_EST_GROUP](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#SYS_MC_EST_GROUP) parameter to 2 to use the ecl EKF.

## What are the advantages and disadvantages of the ecl EKF over other estimators?

Like all estimators, much of the performance comes from the tuning to match sensor characteristics. Tuning is a compromise between accuracy and robustness and although we have attempted to provide a tune that meets the needs of most users, there will be applications where tuning changes are required.

For this reason, no claims for accuracy relative to the legacy combination of attitude\_estimator\_q + local\_position\_estimator have been made and the best choice of estimator will depend on the application and tuning.

### Disadvantages

* The ecl EKF is a complex algorithm that requires a good understanding of extended Kalman filter theory and its application to navigation problems to tune successfully. It is therefore more difficult for users that are not achieving good results to know what to change.
* Local position output data is found in the [vehicle\_local\_position](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/msg/vehicle_local_position.msg) message.
* The ecl EKF uses more logging space.

### Advantages

* The ecl EKF is able to fuse data from sensors with different time delays and data rates in a mathematically consistent way which improves accuracy during dynamic maneuvers once time delay parameters are set correctly.
* The ecl EKF is capable of fusing a large range of different sensor types.
* The ecl EKF detects and reports statistically significant inconsistencies in sensor data, assisting with diagnosis of sensor errors.
* For fixed wing operation, the ecl EKF estimates wind speed with or without an airspeed sensor and is able to use the estimated wind in combination with airspeed measurements and sideslip assumptions to extend the dead-reckoning time available if GPS is lost in flight.
* The ecl EKF estimates 3-axis accelerometer bias which improves accuracy for tailsitters and other vehicles that experience large attitude changes between flight phases.
* The federated architecture \(combined attitude and position/velocity estimation\) means that attitude estimation benefits from all sensor measurements. This should provide the potential for improved attitude estimation if tuned correctly.

## How do I check the EKF performance?

EKF outputs, states and status data are published to a number of uORB topics which are logged to the SD card during flight. The following guide assumes that data has been logged using the .ulog file format. To use the .ulog format, set the SYS\_LOGGER parameter to 1.

Most of the EKF data is found in the [ekf2\_innovations](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/msg/ekf2_innovations.msg) and [estimator\_status](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/msg/estimator_status.msg) uORB messages that are logged to the .ulog file.

A python script that automatically generates analysis plots and metadata can be found [here](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/Tools/ecl_ekf/process_logdata_ekf.py). To use this script file, cd to the `Tools/ecl_ekf` directory and enter `python process_logdata_ekf.py <log_file.ulg>`. This saves performance metadata in a csv file named `<log_file>.mdat.csv` and plots in a pdf file named `<log_file>.pdf`.

Multiple log files in a directory can be analysed using the [batch\_process\_logdata\_ekf.py](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/Tools/ecl_ekf/batch_process_logdata_ekf.py) script. When this has been done, the performance metadata files can be processed to provide a statistical assessment of the estimator performance across the population of logs using the [batch\_process\_metadata\_ekf.py](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/Tools/ecl_ekf/batch_process_metadata_ekf.py) script.

### Output Data

The observation `estimator_innovations`, `estimator_innovation_variances`, and `estimator_innovation_test_ratios` message fields are defined in [estimator_innovations.msg](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/master/msg/estimator_innovations.msg). The messages all have the same field names/types (but different units).

> **Note** The messages have the same fields because they are generated from the same field definition. The `# TOPICS` line (at the end of [the file](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/master/msg/estimator_innovations.msg)) lists the names of the set of messages to be created): ```hagl\_test\_ratio : ratio of the height above ground innovation to the innovation test limit```

Some of the observations are:

* \[0\] Angular tracking error magnitude \(rad\)
* Yaw angle (rad, rad^2) : `heading`
* True Airspeed \(m/s\)^2 : Refer to airspeed\_innov\_var in [ekf2\_innovations](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/msg/ekf2_innovations.msg).
* Synthetic sideslip \(rad^2\) : Refer to beta\_innov\_var in [ekf2\_innovations](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/msg/ekf2_innovations.msg).
* Optical flow XY \(rad/sec\)^2 : Refer to flow\_innov\_var in [ekf2\_innovations](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/msg/ekf2_innovations.msg).

* Drag specific force ((m/s)^2): `drag`
* Velocity and position innovations : per sensor

In addition, each sensor has its own fields for horizontal and vertical position and/or velocity values (where appropriate). These are largely self documenting, and are reproduced below:

    # GPS
    float32[2] gps_hvel # horizontal GPS velocity innovation (m/sec) and innovation variance ((m/sec)**2)
    float32    gps_vvel # vertical GPS velocity innovation (m/sec) and innovation variance ((m/sec)**2)

    float32    aux_vvel # vertical auxiliar velocity innovation from landing target measurement (m/sec) and innovation variance ((m/sec)**2)
    

### Output Complementary Filter

The output complementary filter is used to propagate states forward from the fusion time horizon to current time. To check the magnitude of the angular, velocity and position tracking errors measured at the fusion time horizon, refer to output\_tracking\_error\[3\] in the ekf2\_innovations message.

The index map for vel\_pos\_innov\[6\] is as follows:

* [0] Angular tracking error magnitude (rad)
* \[1\] Velocity tracking error magnitude \(m/s\). The velocity tracking time constant can be adjusted using the [EKF2_TAU_VEL](../advanced/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_TAU_VEL) parameter. Reducing this parameter reduces steady state errors but increases the amount of observation noise on the NED velocity outputs.
* \[2\] Position tracking error magnitude \(m\). The position tracking time constant can be adjusted using the [EKF2_TAU_POS](../advanced/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_TAU_POS) parameter. Reducing this parameter reduces steady state errors but increases the amount of observation noise on the NED position outputs.

### EKF Errors

The EKF contains internal error checking for badly conditioned state and covariance updates. Refer to the filter\_fault\_flags in [estimator\_status](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/msg/estimator_status.msg).

### Observation Errors

There are two categories of observation faults:

* Loss of data. An example of this is a range finder failing to provide a return.
* The innovation, which is the difference between the state prediction and sensor observation is excessive. An example of this is excessive vibration causing a large vertical position error, resulting in the barometer height measurement being rejected.

Both of these can result in observation data being rejected for long enough to cause the EKF to attempt a reset of the states using the sensor observations. All observations have a statistical confidence checks applied to the innovations. The number of standard deviations for the check are controlled by the EKF2\_\*\_GATE parameter for each observation type.

Test levels are available in [estimator\_status](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/msg/estimator_status.msg) as follows:

* mag\_test\_ratio : ratio of the largest magnetometer innovation component to the innovation test limit
* State variances \(diagonals in the covariance matrix\) are constrained to be non-negative.
* pos\_test\_ratio : ratio of the largest horizontal position innovation component to the innovation test limit
* hgt\_test\_ratio : ratio of the vertical position innovation to the innovation test limit
* tas\_test\_ratio : ratio of the true airspeed innovation to the innovation test limit
* vel\_test\_ratio : ratio of the largest velocity innovation component to the innovation test limit

For a binary pass/fail summary for each sensor, refer to innovation\_check\_flags in [estimator\_status](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/msg/estimator_status.msg).

### GPS Quality Checks

The EKF applies a number of GPS quality checks before commencing GPS aiding. These checks are controlled by the [EKF2_GPS_CHECK](../advanced/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_GPS_CHECK) and `EKF2_REQ_*` parameters. This integer will be zero when all required GPS checks have passed. The pass/fail status for these checks is logged in the [estimator\_status](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/msg/estimator_status.msg).gps\_check\_fail\_flags message. If the EKF is not commencing GPS alignment, check the value of the integer against the bitmask definition gps\_check\_fail\_flags in [estimator\_status](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/msg/estimator_status.msg).

### EKF Numerical Errors

The EKF uses single precision floating point operations for all of its computations and first order approximations for derivation of the covariance prediction and update equations in order to reduce processing requirements. This means that it is possible when re-tuning the EKF to encounter conditions where the covariance matrix operations become badly conditioned enough to cause divergence or significant errors in the state estimates.

To prevent this, every covariance and state update step contains the following error detection and correction steps:

* If the innovation variance is less than the observation variance \(this requires a negative state variance which is impossible\) or the covariance update will produce a negative variance for any of the states, then: 
  * The state and covariance update is skipped
  * The corresponding rows and columns in the covariance matrix are reset
  * The failure is recorded in the [estimator\_status](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/msg/estimator_status.msg) filter\_fault\_flags message
* [estimator\_status](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/msg/estimator_status.msg).hgt\_test\_ratio will be greater than 1.0
* An upper limit is applied to state variances.
* Symmetry is forced on the covariance matrix.

After re-tuning the filter, particularly re-tuning that involve reducing the noise variables, the value of `estimator_status.gps_check_fail_flags` should be checked to ensure that it remains zero.

## What should I do if the height estimate is diverging?

The most common cause of EKF height diverging away from GPS and altimeter measurements during flight is clipping and/or aliasing of the IMU measurements caused by vibration. If this is occurring, then the following signs should be evident in the data

* [ekf2\_innovations](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/msg/ekf2_innovations.msg).vel\_pos\_innov\[2\] and [ekf2\_innovations](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/msg/ekf2_innovations.msg).vel\_pos\_innov\[5\] will both have the same sign.
* Plot the height innovation test ratio - [estimator\_status](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/msg/estimator_status.msg).hgt\_test\_ratio

The recommended first step is to ensure that the autopilot is isolated from the airframe using an effective isolation mounting system. An isolation mount has 6 degrees of freedom, and therefore 6 resonant frequencies. As a general rule, the 6 resonant frequencies of the autopilot on the isolation mount should be above 25Hz to avoid interaction with the autopilot dynamics and below the frequency of the motors.

An isolation mount can make vibration worse if the resonant frequencies coincide with motor or propeller blade passage frequencies.

The EKF can be made more resistant to vibration induced height divergence by making the following parameter changes:

* Double the value of the innovation gate for the primary height sensor. If using barometric height this is [EKF2_BARO_GATE](../advanced/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_BARO_GATE).
* Increase the value of [EKF2_ACC_NOISE](../advanced/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_ACC_NOISE) to 0.5 initially. If divergence is still occurring, increase in further increments of 0.1 but do not go above 1.0

Note that the effect of these changes will make the EKF more sensitive to errors in GPS vertical velocity and barometric pressure.

## What should I do if the position estimate is diverging?

The most common causes of position divergence are:

* High vibration levels. 
  * Fix by improving mechanical isolation of the autopilot.
  * Increasing the value of [EKF2_ACC_NOISE](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_ACC_NOISE) and [EKF2_GYR_NOISE](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_GYR_NOISE) can help, but does make the EKF more vulnerable to GPS glitches.
* Large gyro bias offsets. 
  * Fix by re-calibrating the gyro. Check for excessive temperature sensitivity \(&gt; 3 deg/sec bias change during warm-up from a cold start and replace the sensor if affected of insulate to to slow the rate of temperature change.
* Bad yaw alignment 
  * Check the magnetometer calibration and alignment.
  * Check the heading shown QGC is within within 15 deg truth
* Poor GPS accuracy 
  * Check for interference
  * Improve separation and shielding
  * Check flying location for GPS signal obstructions and reflectors \(nearby tall buildings\)
* Loss of GPS

Determining which of these is the primary cause requires a methodical approach to analysis of the EKF log data:

* Plot the velocity innovation test ratio - [estimator\_status](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/msg/estimator_status.msg).vel\_test\_ratio
* Plot the horizontal position innovation test ratio - [estimator\_status](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/msg/estimator_status.msg).pos\_test\_ratio
* Plot the magnetometer innovation test ratio - [estimator\_status](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/msg/estimator_status.msg).mag\_test\_ratio
* Magnetometer XYZ \(gauss\) : Refer to mag\_innov\[3\] in [ekf2\_innovations](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/msg/ekf2_innovations.msg).
* Plot the GPS receiver reported speed accuracy - [vehicle\_gps\_position](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/master/msg/vehicle_gps_position.msg).s\_variance\_m\_s
* Plot the IMU delta angle state estimates - [estimator\_status](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/msg/estimator_status.msg).states\[10\], states\[11\] and states\[12\]
* Plot the EKF internal high frequency vibration metrics: 
  * Delta angle coning vibration - [estimator\_status](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/msg/estimator_status.msg).vibe\[0\]
  * High frequency delta angle vibration - [estimator\_status](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/msg/estimator_status.msg).vibe\[1\]
  * High frequency delta velocity vibration - [estimator_status](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/master/msg/estimator_status.msg).vibe\[2\]

During normal operation, all the test ratios should remain below 0.5 with only occasional spikes above this as shown in the example below from a successful flight:

![Position, Velocity, Height and Magnetometer Test Ratios](../../assets/ecl/test_ratios_-_successful.png)

The following plot shows the EKF vibration metrics for a multirotor with good isolation. The landing shock and the increased vibration during takeoff and landing can be seen. Insufficient data has been gathered with these metrics to provide specific advice on maximum thresholds.

![Vibration metrics - successful](../../assets/ecl/vibration_metrics_-_successful.png)

The above vibration metrics are of limited value as the presence of vibration at a frequency close to the IMU sampling frequency \(1 kHz for most boards\) will cause offsets to appear in the data that do not show up in the high frequency vibration metrics. The only way to detect aliasing errors is in their effect on inertial navigation accuracy and the rise in innovation levels.

In addition to generating large position and velocity test ratios of &gt; 1.0, the different error mechanisms affect the other test ratios in different ways:

### Determination of Excessive Vibration

High vibration levels normally affect vertical position and velocity innovations as well as the horizontal components. Magnetometer test levels are only affected to a small extent.

\(insert example plots showing bad vibration here\)

### Determination of Excessive Gyro Bias

Large gyro bias offsets are normally characterised by a change in the value of delta angle bias greater than 5E-4 during flight \(equivalent to ~3 deg/sec\) and can also cause a large increase in the magnetometer test ratio if the yaw axis is affected. Height is normally unaffected other than extreme cases. Switch on bias value of up to 5 deg/sec can be tolerated provided the filter is given time time settle before flying . Pre-flight checks performed by the commander should prevent arming if the position is diverging.

\(insert example plots showing bad gyro bias here\)

### Determination of Poor Yaw Accuracy

Bad yaw alignment causes a velocity test ratio that increases rapidly when the vehicle starts moving due inconsistency in the direction of velocity calculated by the inertial nav and the GPS measurement. Magnetometer innovations are slightly affected. Height is normally unaffected.

\(insert example plots showing bad yaw alignment here\)

### Determination of Poor GPS Accuracy

Poor GPS accuracy is normally accompanied by a rise in the reported velocity error of the receiver in conjunction with a rise in innovations. Transient errors due to multipath, obscuration and interference are more common causes. Here is an example of a temporary loss of GPS accuracy where the multi-rotor started drifting away from its loiter location and had to be corrected using the sticks. The rise in [estimator\_status](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/msg/estimator_status.msg).vel\_test\_ratio to greater than 1 indicates the GPs velocity was inconsistent with other measurements and has been rejected.

![GPS glitch - test ratios](../../assets/ecl/gps_glitch_-_test_ratios.png)

This is accompanied with rise in the GPS receivers reported velocity accuracy which indicates that it was likely a GPS error.

![GPS Glitch - reported receiver accuracy](../../assets/ecl/gps_glitch_-_reported_receiver_accuracy.png)

If we also look at the GPS horizontal velocity innovations and innovation variances, we can see the large spike in North velocity innovation that accompanies this GPS 'glitch' event.

![GPS Glitch - velocity innovations](../../assets/ecl/gps_glitch_-_velocity_innovations.png)

### Determination of GPS Data Loss

Loss of GPS data will be shown by the velocity and position innovation test ratios 'flat-lining'. If this occurs, check the other GPS status data in `vehicle_gps_position` for further information.

The following plot shows the NED GPS velocity innovations `ekf2_innovations_0.vel_pos_innov[0 ... 2]`, the GPS NE position innovations `ekf2_innovations_0.vel_pos_innov[3 ... 4]` and the Baro vertical position innovation `ekf2_innovations_0.vel_pos_innov[5]` generated from a simulated VTOL flight using SITL Gazebo.

The simulated GPS was made to lose lock at 73 seconds. Note the NED velocity innovations and NE position innovations 'flat-line' after GPs is lost. Note that after 10 seconds without GPS data, the EKF reverts back to a static position mode using the last known position and the NE position innovations start to change again.

![GPS Data Loss - in SITL](../../assets/ecl/gps_data_loss_-_velocity_innovations.png)

### Barometer Ground Effect Compensation

If the vehicle has the tendency during landing to climb back into the air when close to the ground, the most likely cause is barometer ground effect.

This is caused when air pushed down by the propellers hits the ground and creates a high pressure zone below the drone. The result is a lower reading of pressure altitude, leading to an unwanted climb being commanded. The figure below shows a typical situation where the ground effect is present. Note how the barometer signal dips at the beginning and end of the flight.

![Barometer ground effect](../../assets/ecl/gnd_effect.png)

You can enable *ground effect compensation* to fix this problem:

* From the plot estimate the magnitude of the barometer dip during takeoff or landing. In the plot above one can read a barometer dip of about 6 meters during landing.
* Then set the parameter [EKF2_GND_EFF_DZ](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_GND_EFF_DZ) to that value and add a 10 percent margin. Therefore, in this case a value of 6.6 meters would be a good starting point.

If a terrain estimate is available (e.g. the vehicle is equipped with a range finder) then you can additionally specify [EKF2_GND_MAX_HGT](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#EKF2_GND_MAX_HGT), the above ground-level altitude below which ground effect compensation should be activated. If no terrain estimate is available this parameter will have no effect and the system will use heuristics to determine if ground effect compensation should be activated.
